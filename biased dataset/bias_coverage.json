We have lived together since almost the start of our relationship and have always been extremely close. One of our issues has always been sexual needs. We split up a couple of days ago over this because he met someone at work who he immediately wanted to fuck their brains out and felt guilty and like it wasn't fair to me.\n\nI explained to him tonight that every human in a relationship has these feelings at one time or another (correct me if I'm wrong). I too have wanted to fuck other people before but have never considered ending the relationship because of it. I feel like it's important these things remain sexual-only and no emotions involved which he has already stated would be the case with the current girl in question.\n\nHe also didn't have many other sexual partners before me so it's definitely coming into play. This situation is also something I have considered in the past without him (being polyamorous\/non- monogamous-not sure?)

I'm trying to reach the point now of knowing its my only body and working it. I'm in the process of losing 30 lbs and have lost weight since we started dating. My weight has always been a strain on my sexual confidence especially in bed with him. \n\nSo on one hand I feel mostly okay with letting him fuck other women (and me fucking other men when I find someone appropriate) but I don't want to be jealous.

We actually got to know each other for almost two years without really hinting on any desire of one another. We just connected and felt good around each other. Then, one night we were just drinking wine while talking about mindless stuff when she suddenly confessed her feelings for me which prompted me to confess mine. We started flirting and I ended up kissing her leading to our now relationship.\n\nHowever, she asked for our relationship to be kept a secret since she has a 10 year old son and is friend to some of my relatives. She's scared of getting judged and\/or criticized by people because she's \"officialy\" ina relationship with her father's son although he has never been there for her, as I'm told. They never married and, although he has denied it, she thinks he has another family because he only visits his son a couple hours on saturday. \n\nEven though, she has kept the fact that they're not a couple to her son. He used to think his parents are married and his father is just off to work and only has free time on saturdays but has recently begun to ask a lot about his father and the reason why he's almost absent.\n\nI get along with her son quite well and he seems to look at me as some kind of old bro. But just yesterday he caught us having sex, she was surprised and scared and asked me to immediately leave her place. She tells me he's acting kind of angry and\/or disappointed at her, he doesn't speak to her or let her hold him.

Coming up to my turn where for a good mile (in Dominic torretto voice) I'm free. On the turn there was a huge size puddle of water. I tried to avoid it completly but knew and figured that the front right tire will hit the water. Remember that word \"hydroplane\", yeah I fucked up. The left front tire went over then sunk, causing me the turn into the side of the road. Closer to the edge, the water is deeper. My engine choked, I'm really fucked. Knew trying to keep turning the key will only make things worst. I got out, in ankle deep water, had the bitch in neutral and pushed to the corner of the turn. On the bright side of this whole predicament, a trucker got out of his rig and helped me push the water logged car to the edge. Once out of the water, I tried to give life to my racecar. Once she turned back on I booked it home. Ran the same as before except for a knocking noise. The noise just hurts thinking about it.

{"info":{"id":"t3_2e5pww","post":"Like most TIFUs, this happened several months ago on a dry summer night. I was trying to fall asleep a bit earlier than usual (around 11PM) because I had a job interview at 9AM, but kept waking up every 5 minute because of this one fucking mosquito that would just pierce through my skin and bounce without even getting a decent meal from my vasculature. My girlfriend, who is a deep sleeper, had already fallen asleep at the time but I could tell she was distressed because she was unconsciously scratching herself from the mosquito bites. This mosquito would not leave us the fuck alone and around 1AM, I tried to catch it by using my phone light to attract this fucker but he was so elusive that I had failed countless times. I decided enough was enough and went full psycho. I turned on all the lights (my girlfriend was still sleeping), and it took me a while but I searched every corner of my room until I found this small ass mosquito that looked fat as fuck from all the blood it had drained from my precious body. I didn't want to kill it right away because that just didn't seem fair for the both of us. It took me another 30 minutes to capture this bastard in my bathroom and I tossed some green GoldBond (I use it to cool my balls after a shower) on to this fucker thinking it would slow it down. I kept peppering this fucker with GoldBond and missed so many times until my bathtub and my girlfriend's bright pink towels were completely caked with this magical shit. The GoldBond seemed to do pretty well in slowing it down because I finally caught one of its legs with a tweezer and proceeded to torture and dissect it. By the time I went to bed, it was around 5AM and took me another hour to fall asleep from the adrenaline and stress the mosquito had caused me.

{"info":{"id":"t3_wx3g6","post":"Through my studies (bachelors), I have become more and more disturbed about the \"scientific\" nature of finance. \n\nQuick, what percentage of mutual funds \"beat the market\", i.e. perform better than the index? Studies generally find the number to be between 20 to 30 percent, but in 2011 the number went down to 14%. If these people are so armed with expertise and knowledge, why do people who don't understand anything about financial theory get more just by passively investing in an index fund? If anything, financial \"knowledge\" seems to do more harm than good.\n\nWhen looking at the stuff they teach in universities, you have to wonder how they keep on believing these theories despite the mountain of counterevidence. Stocks are assumed to generate returns relative to risk, quantified as beta in CAPM. Yet, beta has had almost zero correlation with stock returns starting in 1982. If you look at the studies that confirm beta's predictive power, they all used data from the 1970s. But people still use beta to create portfolios.\n\nHow about efficient market theory? Under the theory, stock bubbles should not exist since everythingn is properly priced. But they do exist. Instagram valued at 1 billion despite having no revenue? Definitely properly priced.\n\nEven option pricing models are ridiculous. One model assumes that you can borrow money at the risk-free rate and stocks only generate risk-free rate returns. The black-scholes model also assumes that risk is normally distributed, without looking at historical data, leading to black and scholes' own bankruptcy. \n\nWanna know how we price stocks? We pull magic numbers out of our asses and make it interact with other equally bullshit number to come up with an arbitrary value. Then we try to convince other people that our bullshit is, in fact, legit. The only way stock valuation models are accurate is if stock analysts are clairvoyant and can see 10 years into the future.

For the last month he insisted he didn't need to say \"I love you\" and we almost never had sex. Awful. \n\nAbout a month later my ex (Steve) from less than an hour away just dumped his ex and we entered a sort of FWB situation. We had been there before because we have excellent sexual chemistry, but the romance wasn't there for YEARS.

We both achieved long-sought goals of physical fitness and he was a good motivator. The past two weeks he's been getting cozier. Four days ago he came over and we finally kissed again and we had a loooong talk. I explained that telling somebody you don't love them, and wont have sex with them, isn't a real relationship. He had many many emotional outbursts in the past, which I explained were totally unacceptable. \n\nThen he pulled what feels like a high school girl move and opened up about a dark secret (long story is he was taken advantage of by a Sugar Daddy who helped pay for college expenses and it had repercussions that manifested as intimacy issues). I told him I didn't really give a shit about it. I also told him that I'd be open to another attempt at a relationship but I wont call him my boyfriend or partner until \"It damn well feels like it\".

He had an awesome name. Idk how i can make something comparable.. We'll call him Barry Powers. It wad like that, a superhero type name. So anyway, we heard the name Barry Powers during freshman roll call and we were like \"damn! What a sick name!\" And made it our ultimate mission to find this guy.\nAnd so we searched.\nIt took weeks. \nWhenever we met other freshmen, we asked, \"do you know Barry Powers?\" And other questions like \"what does he look like?\", \"where did you last see him?\", and \"where can we find him?\".  We really wanted to find this kid and congratulate him on his name.\nSo, after two weeks of this walking around and searching and asking, we ask someone about Mr. Powers and their answer is \"oh, he's right there.\"  we get freakin hyped and beeline to the dude, who looks at us with fear in his eyes. Thinking back on it, we had the poor kid, who was eating lunch on his own, in a corner surround by 4 of us. I asked, \"hey man. You Barry Powers?\"\n\"y-yeah..\" He managed to respond. \n\"oh, well, you have a sweet name!\" I said.\n\"ok..\" Mumbled Powers. Now, the next moment was like the end of an always sunny episode; my friends and I looked around and each other and decided, \"oh cool we did it, moving on now.\"\nIt was only a little bit later that we heard that this poor guy thought this was some massive hazing ritual the whole time.

However, I noticed that almost immediately (within like 2 weeks) after we broke up this guy she met from a club started hitting on her. She claims to have no attraction towards him but anyone with a pair of eyes can see there's a mutual attraction. Now I don't like this guy because he was hitting on her while we were still dating.

{"info":{"id":"t3_wx3g6","post":"Through my studies (bachelors), I have become more and more disturbed about the \"scientific\" nature of finance. \n\nQuick, what percentage of mutual funds \"beat the market\", i.e. perform better than the index? Studies generally find the number to be between 20 to 30 percent, but in 2011 the number went down to 14%. If these people are so armed with expertise and knowledge, why do people who don't understand anything about financial theory get more just by passively investing in an index fund? If anything, financial \"knowledge\" seems to do more harm than good.\n\nWhen looking at the stuff they teach in universities, you have to wonder how they keep on believing these theories despite the mountain of counterevidence. Stocks are assumed to generate returns relative to risk, quantified as beta in CAPM. Yet, beta has had almost zero correlation with stock returns starting in 1982. If you look at the studies that confirm beta's predictive power, they all used data from the 1970s. But people still use beta to create portfolios.\n\nHow about efficient market theory? Under the theory, stock bubbles should not exist since everythingn is properly priced. But they do exist. Instagram valued at 1 billion despite having no revenue? Definitely properly priced.\n\nEven option pricing models are ridiculous. One model assumes that you can borrow money at the risk-free rate and stocks only generate risk-free rate returns. The black-scholes model also assumes that risk is normally distributed, without looking at historical data, leading to black and scholes' own bankruptcy. \n\nWanna know how we price stocks? We pull magic numbers out of our asses and make it interact with other equally bullshit number to come up with an arbitrary value. Then we try to convince other people that our bullshit is, in fact, legit. The only way stock valuation models are accurate is if stock analysts are clairvoyant and can see 10 years into the future.

He has purchased an apartment and a plane ticket and is planning to come out here at the end of October. \n\nMy parents, however, are completely against it. They've gone overboard (my mom threw away everything in my room back home, she's trying to convince my dad to sell my car, and she's trying to get me to pay for everything entirely on my own i.e. insurance and whatnot). \n\nMy mom and I were always friends and my dad was the mean one, but the roles have flipped, even though my dad is still against it too. They are concerned I'll begin to completely ignore my friends and not get involved with anything (I'm in music ensembles, the cycling club, and the residence hall senate).\n\nHe completely refuses to wait any longer, which I fully understand. At home, he has only one real friend due to everything being expensive in New York City so he doesn't like going out with people. He isn't close with his family and is just very lonely. He will not wait any longer to move, regardless of what my parents will do.\n\nI don't want to completely ruin my relationship with my parents, I mean, they're my parents and they've given up a lot for me over the past 18 years.

Please let me explain. \n\nMy boyfriend, lets call him Bubba, have been together for almost four years. We've been friends for almost seven. For the past two years I have been living with him and his Mother. My Mom and I had a very bad relationship, so his Mom graciously invited me into her home. For the most past, we really love each other. We do fight, but I can honestly see myself settling with him.

In about a year, I will be told where to live and work after my graduation by my employer, but for now I don't know. \n\nShe says if she moves with me after college, that she will be sacrificing her career and will not ever get to be an independent person. It really has been bothering her and depressing her because she recently realised she doesn't know what to do after college. It seems like this idea just popped up out of nowhere, we have been happy together. So she says we shouldn't be together anymore. I don't think her logic makes sense.

He is very business savy and wealthy. \n\nWe had lived together for a full 3 weeks, but being with a traveling business man is not easy, and he felt pressured into commitment. He being 42 told me I was not right to be his future wife, so he kicked me out. I am in my late 20s and very much in love with him. \n\nHe is cold but showed his love in the form of helping my company get off the ground. He invested time and money getting things set up for me. Suddenly he wants me gone but still hopes to participate in my business ventures. I begin no contact and he is shocked. I admit I stalked his facebook, he was depressed up until yesterday. Today I launched my online store and made a Tinder account (I found him there a week ago). Today he emails me a very business-like email saying how it's stupid talking through assistants when he could just contact me about my business plan. He offers all the financial and business help he knows I need. \n\nA part of me knows it's because he wants in on my future business (it's fucking genius) a part of me hopes it's because he hates waking up alone and being completely alone. He was incredibly depressed the last few weeks we were together. I was worried and asked him to get psych help. Now he's throwing money at the situation, asking for nothing in return. He knew I needed a couple of thousand for a lawyer, a bit more for merchandise, etc. He writes a detailed pricing email explaining me my business model but says he wants nothing more than my success and maybe a bit of his initial investment. \n\nI'm lost without him both emotionally and business-wise but somehow could make it work without him(loan from family), although not as well as he ever could, not a marketer at all.

I apologize if this post is kind of all over the place, but trying to quick explain the situation. \n\nMy FH and I are both military (LDR for 4 years) and stationed at different bases.  We have been talking marriage for over a year, planning on doing a simple backyard ceremony within the next year or two.  Fast forward to recent times, and he has gotten overseas orders, leaving in fall of this year.  I am unable to go with him unless we are married.  \n\nTo top it all off, I was recently deployed for 6 months, and at the end of my deployment, my FH deployed to a different area.  By the time he gets back (late spring) it will have been a year since we've seen each other. \n\nAnyway, after discussion, we have decided to get married before he goes overseas.  Then, either I can try to apply to get orders with him, or I will be eligible to go be with him after my contract is up next year. \n\nHe is coming to visit me after he gets back from his deployment, and we have been discussing doing a court house marriage at that time.  The problem with this, is that both of our families would not be able to make it at that time (both his dad and my grandma are dealing with serious illnesses at this time).  We do not want to disappoint our families by getting married without them, but we absolutely cannot wait on the marriage due to the military. \n\nSo now for the advice....would we be terrible people for eloping\/doing a court house wedding by ourselves....but only announcing engagement to everyone at that time?

We were high school sweethearts and have made it through almost 2 full years of college. We have a very loving relationship and I'm very happy to be in a relationship with her. \n\nMy girlfriend (let's call her Sue) is in a sorority and is very active in it. She recently went to a dance they call Formal, and had a blast. It's custom to take a date to these things, and since I wasn't there she took someone whose friends were going but otherwise wasn't technically allowed into the dance. I didn't have a problem with it because I figured they would just hang out with their separate friend groups once in the dance. \n\nSue told me that's exactly what happened and how she even got stood up by the guy - he kind of just showed up with his friends at the dance instead of meeting up beforehand. I was glad she had a good time despite that.\n\nI just checked Facebook and Sue has a new profile picture. It's her and the guy from last night. She is laughing and having a good time, with her hands on his back, and he's doing a somewhat funny face.

{"info":{"id":"t3_4e471z","post":"I graduated in 2013 with a BA in Political Science. When I started college I thought I wanted to go to law school, but I realized that I only wanted to attend law school for my parents. Then I thought I'd want to pursue a career in international relations or something like that, but I just didn't want to go into more debt with more school. About a year after I graduated, I started to work as a substitute teacher, so I figured I'd pursue teaching. While getting into an alt cert program, I started working at Ross (the store) in October of 2014. While at Ross, I had so much pressure on me to find a teaching job with health insurance. Fast-forward to August 2015, I finally got a teaching job! But that job was hell on earth. I suffered from anxiety and panic attacks, so after two months, I had to quit. I went to a therapist (which I'm still seeing) and I'm doing much better, so now I have a job at Sears.\n\nI'm thankful for my job, but I'm 25 going to be 26 in May and I'm still living with my parents. I've been trying to save money, but I have a $450 monthly bill that I have to pay for that alt cert program. Luckily, May will be the last month I have to pay on that. I've been trying to apply to teach English abroad, but I just got rejected by EPIK, so I don't think that's going to work out.\n\nI just don't want to work in retail anymore. I'm not saying that retail is all bad, but I just want something a little more. But now I feel like this is all I can do right now. I'm starting to feel like I'm only qualified for retail.

However, I noticed that almost immediately (within like 2 weeks) after we broke up this guy she met from a club started hitting on her. She claims to have no attraction towards him but anyone with a pair of eyes can see there's a mutual attraction. Now I don't like this guy because he was hitting on her while we were still dating. I just got onto Facebook today to see her and a picture of him together celebrating his 21st birthday.\n\nI know I'm the one that broke it off and it's my fault for doing so, but I can't help but feel...betrayed?

You Barry Powers?\"\n\"y-yeah..\" He managed to respond. \n\"oh, well, you have a sweet name!\" I said.\n\"ok..\" Mumbled Powers.

I finally decided on the Forerunner 305 since it would do everything I wanted and was a good price (even though it's huge).\n\nBest price I found online was through Amazon for around $130, with free shipping if I wanted to wait 1-2 weeks. It was available at the local Best Buy for $150. Did a quick search and found a printable coupon good for the month of February at Best Buy for 20% off all \"Health & Fitness\" products.\n\nWent in to Best Buy and the price was $160 on the shelf. I found an employee (just happened to be a cute girl) nearby and told her I wanted to get the 305. She said she had that model and loved it...even more than some of the more expensive ones she tried (even though it's huge). She said she has run some marathons and we chatted a little bit about how I was just starting to run.

She has always had huskies, and was ready to get another, as her last dog had passed away a year ago. \n\nAfter careful talking and collaboration with her, we decided that as a \"Christmas gift\" I would pay for her puppy. I am normally against the puppy for Christmas thing, but she wanted a puppy, the time of year just worked out like that. \n\nI have 3 dogs myself, all rescues, I wasn't overly familiar with the process of buying a dog.

The \"breeder\" wouldn't let me on the property to see the dogs (Sign #2). The breeder also had no organization, no contracts, no vet records, no health certificate, nothing. I know I shouldn't have gotten the dog from him. I supported a puppy mill. This poor pup is stained with pee and feces. \n\nSo why did I do it? I was so caught up in getting my friend a husky, which again she knew about, that I looked past my better judgement. \n\nNot to mention, upon meeting this guy to pick up the puppy, I was alone.

Long story short, it seems my girlfriend doesnt like very much when I hang out with my two friends Julia and Hannah.  Today my gf was out of town for something school related, so I hanged with my two friends.  I always gave Megan info like \"yeah i think ima hang with Julia and Hanna when you're out of town\" and she usually says something like \"haha okay sounds good.\"  And I ask her \"you're fine with that right\" and she'd say \"With Julia? Ya of course.\" There has been a few times where like we'd go to Spot coffee and get some food together, always the 3 of us (Me, Julia, and Hannah). I have always believed Megan had not cared... until today.  \n\nToday Julia and Hannah told me that Megan isnt always very nice to them.  Such as, giving \"looks\" to them in the hall.  Or not saying Hi if they see each other.  Apparently Megan only says hello and stuff when Im with her.  Anyway, I never knew this.

{"info":{"id":"t3_2rwiht","post":"I've been with my boyfriend for 3+ years and I have started thinking about the future and marriage. One thing that bothers me sometimes is that I have been purposefully vague about my past relationships and I don't know if I need to open up to him and tell him everything. We are both quiet, introverted people that don't necessarily share every minute detail, so it hasn't been a big deal. \n\nI was in an emotionally abusive relationship in the past, and had a couple of short-term relationships after that where I was still emotionally unstable. I did some things I am not proud of (breaking up by no contact with one guy, dated another controlling man and then kissed someone else so we would break up) when I was younger. However, I've matured and learned about healthy relationships. I've been in 1-2 healthy relationships before I met my current boyfriend. Most people who know me now don't know any of this, and I an genuinely happy and fulfilled in my personal and professional life. It's only when I sometimes think back to the past I sort of freeze up inside.\n\nI have tried to see a couple of therapists (one after I ended the abusive relationship, and one a few years after that). But both of them stopped seeing me after a few sessions because I seemed pretty well-adjusted and was capable of dealing with the issues. I got some good advice about accepting myself and having healthy habits (exercise, eating well, sleeping well, etc.) to cope, but otherwise nothing major.

She will immediately sit after I'm done petting as well. She's extremely jump and the tiniest noise causes her to curl into a ball and hide her head behind the toilet. She doesn't play, at least not with me, and a laser pointer causes her to go stroke mode and again, hide her head behind the toilet. She doesn't hiss at anything that I've found out yet..

We are both quiet, introverted people that don't necessarily share every minute detail, so it hasn't been a big deal. \n\nI was in an emotionally abusive relationship in the past, and had a couple of short-term relationships after that where I was still emotionally unstable. I did some things I am not proud of (breaking up by no contact with one guy, dated another controlling man and then kissed someone else so we would break up) when I was younger. However, I've matured and learned about healthy relationships. I've been in 1-2 healthy relationships before I met my current boyfriend. Most people who know me now don't know any of this, and I an genuinely happy and fulfilled in my personal and professional life. It's only when I sometimes think back to the past I sort of freeze up inside.\n\nI have tried to see a couple of therapists (one after I ended the abusive relationship, and one a few years after that). But both of them stopped seeing me after a few sessions because I seemed pretty well-adjusted and was capable of dealing with the issues. I got some good advice about accepting myself and having healthy habits (exercise, eating well, sleeping well, etc.) to cope, but otherwise nothing major. The message I took away was that the past is in the past and I should work on the here and now. \n\nMy question is, do I need to tell my current boyfriend the entire truth? He knows about the abusive relationship (not the details, just that I was in one) and that I was \"wild\" in my youth (but again, not specifically what). I am very happy in my current relationship, we are both supportive of each other, and this never comes up.

{"info":{"id":"t3_2rwiht","post":"I've been with my boyfriend for 3+ years and I have started thinking about the future and marriage. One thing that bothers me sometimes is that I have been purposefully vague about my past relationships and I don't know if I need to open up to him and tell him everything. We are both quiet, introverted people that don't necessarily share every minute detail, so it hasn't been a big deal. \n\nI was in an emotionally abusive relationship in the past, and had a couple of short-term relationships after that where I was still emotionally unstable. I did some things I am not proud of (breaking up by no contact with one guy, dated another controlling man and then kissed someone else so we would break up) when I was younger. However, I've matured and learned about healthy relationships. I've been in 1-2 healthy relationships before I met my current boyfriend. Most people who know me now don't know any of this, and I an genuinely happy and fulfilled in my personal and professional life. It's only when I sometimes think back to the past I sort of freeze up inside.\n\nI have tried to see a couple of therapists (one after I ended the abusive relationship, and one a few years after that). But both of them stopped seeing me after a few sessions because I seemed pretty well-adjusted and was capable of dealing with the issues. I got some good advice about accepting myself and having healthy habits (exercise, eating well, sleeping well, etc.) to cope, but otherwise nothing major. The message I took away was that the past is in the past and I should work on the here and now. \n\nMy question is, do I need to tell my current boyfriend the entire truth? He knows about the abusive relationship (not the details, just that I was in one) and that I was \"wild\" in my youth (but again, not specifically what). I am very happy in my current relationship, we are both supportive of each other, and this never comes up.

Please let me explain. \n\nMy boyfriend, lets call him Bubba, have been together for almost four years. We've been friends for almost seven. For the past two years I have been living with him and his Mother. My Mom and I had a very bad relationship, so his Mom graciously invited me into her home. For the most past, we really love each other. We do fight, but I can honestly see myself settling with him. He's the most generous man I've ever encontured. \n\nBack to the question, Bubba applied to a very prestigious school. I can't afford to leave the city yet, so I was just going to move downtown and go to school there. This would mean we would be close to three hours apart. I know a lot of people can make long distance relationships work, but I knew I couldn't. It's been making me miserable thinking about not being with him whenever I want. Plus, we have two cats and he would be taking them. I didn't want to split them up because they love each other. \n\nToday he found out that he didn't get in. Of course, he is crushed. He's now doubting his intelligence and the fact that he went back to school. He took off a few years and when we started dating I motivated him to go back. Since he has been back, he has been excelling in every class. Everyone thought he would get in without a problem. To make it worse his sister got in and his parents, unintentionally, tend to compare them to one another. I want to be there for him, but I'm happy.

I get really impatient and sometimes just feel like telling him to hurry up (of course I don't, but I really feel like doing so). \n\nI asked him today, very gently, why he spoke so slow, and he said he just gets thoughts very slowly in his brain.

We were high school sweethearts and have made it through almost 2 full years of college. We have a very loving relationship and I'm very happy to be in a relationship with her. \n\nMy girlfriend (let's call her Sue) is in a sorority and is very active in it. She recently went to a dance they call Formal, and had a blast. It's custom to take a date to these things, and since I wasn't there she took someone whose friends were going but otherwise wasn't technically allowed into the dance. I didn't have a problem with it because I figured they would just hang out with their separate friend groups once in the dance. \n\nSue told me that's exactly what happened and how she even got stood up by the guy - he kind of just showed up with his friends at the dance instead of meeting up beforehand. I was glad she had a good time despite that.\n\nI just checked Facebook and Sue has a new profile picture. It's her and the guy from last night. She is laughing and having a good time, with her hands on his back, and he's doing a somewhat funny face.

Thinking back on it, we had the poor kid, who was eating lunch on his own, in a corner surround by 4 of us. I asked, \"hey man. You Barry Powers?\"\n\"y-yeah..\" He managed to respond. \n\"oh, well, you have a sweet name!\" I said.\n\"ok..\" Mumbled Powers.

{"info":{"id":"t3_wx3g6","post":"Through my studies (bachelors), I have become more and more disturbed about the \"scientific\" nature of finance. \n\nQuick, what percentage of mutual funds \"beat the market\", i.e. perform better than the index? Studies generally find the number to be between 20 to 30 percent, but in 2011 the number went down to 14%. If these people are so armed with expertise and knowledge, why do people who don't understand anything about financial theory get more just by passively investing in an index fund? If anything, financial \"knowledge\" seems to do more harm than good.\n\nWhen looking at the stuff they teach in universities, you have to wonder how they keep on believing these theories despite the mountain of counterevidence. Stocks are assumed to generate returns relative to risk, quantified as beta in CAPM. Yet, beta has had almost zero correlation with stock returns starting in 1982. If you look at the studies that confirm beta's predictive power, they all used data from the 1970s. But people still use beta to create portfolios.\n\nHow about efficient market theory? Under the theory, stock bubbles should not exist since everythingn is properly priced. But they do exist. Instagram valued at 1 billion despite having no revenue? Definitely properly priced.\n\nEven option pricing models are ridiculous. One model assumes that you can borrow money at the risk-free rate and stocks only generate risk-free rate returns. The black-scholes model also assumes that risk is normally distributed, without looking at historical data, leading to black and scholes' own bankruptcy. \n\nWanna know how we price stocks? We pull magic numbers out of our asses and make it interact with other equally bullshit number to come up with an arbitrary value. Then we try to convince other people that our bullshit is, in fact, legit. The only way stock valuation models are accurate is if stock analysts are clairvoyant and can see 10 years into the future.

I finally decided on the Forerunner 305 since it would do everything I wanted and was a good price (even though it's huge).\n\nBest price I found online was through Amazon for around $130, with free shipping if I wanted to wait 1-2 weeks. It was available at the local Best Buy for $150. Did a quick search and found a printable coupon good for the month of February at Best Buy for 20% off all \"Health & Fitness\" products.\n\nWent in to Best Buy and the price was $160 on the shelf. I found an employee (just happened to be a cute girl) nearby and told her I wanted to get the 305. She said she had that model and loved it...even more than some of the more expensive ones she tried (even though it's huge). She said she has run some marathons and we chatted a little bit about how I was just starting to run. She told me about some of the runs in the area, how the best ones tend to end with beer, and overall was very pleasant and informative while waiting in line at the cashier. I definitely hope to meet more cool people like her while pursuing this sport.\n\nSo I got to the cashier and the 305 rang up at $160 as expected. I mentioned the web site price was $150 and he price matched it. Then I gave him the 20% off coupon and it wouldn't scan. He tried typing in the number and it wouldn't take it. So he tried again and it accepted the coupon, but didn't apply the discount to the 305. He read the coupon, looked at the GPS, manually entered the 20% off and had a supervisor approve it. Super easy, out the door for $120.\n\nThe coupon should work on any \"Garmin Fitness GPS\" (that's an actual category on the Best Buy website), as well as any heart rate monitor or other brand of fitness GPS.\n\nHere's a link to the coupon.

My friend and his girlfriend.\n\nNow, I knew they were having issues, but I had no idea how fucked up and abusive my friend was being. He constantly treats her like she's second class, puts her down, completely disregards anything she has to say and when she sticks up for herself or argues back he has no problem getting physical. I would've never expected this type of bullshit from him, and he's never even come close to treating another human being like this, let alone a girlfriend\n\nThe worst part is, this girl is absolutely amazing. She has the sweetest smile and is probably the most kind, caring person in the fucking world. Over the coarse of their relationship, her and I became good friends and very close and I get to hear all of the bullshit my friend pulls. I get the 1 am Facebook messages saying how he wants to break up with her.

{"info":{"id":"t3_3sdfle","post":"My girlfriend and I have been dating for just about 2 years\u2014she was my first real girlfriend, and the girl I lost my virginity to. I met her online, and we instantly hit it off and could tell that we wanted to meet each other in real life. Our first date confirmed that we had a very strong connection, and from there we became exclusive. From the start, things were going perfect: we'd never ever get into fights, we'd always have a good time, the sex was amazing, etc.\n\nI met her after I graduated high school (right when I went from a very shy overweight kid, to a more confident good looking guy), so she was my first real experience with a girl. At the time, I really wanted to find a relationship with someone I could connect with before losing my viriginity, and she was the right girl. To be honest, at the time I didn't think I'd be here, 2 years in\u2014 still dating her.\n\nRecentley, I've been feeling a little depressed (just lost my job after graduating college, not being able to move out, family problems, etc.) and also a bit \"trapped\" in the relationship. I still love her, and enjoy spending time with her. However, a part of me really wants to end it and experience the single life, spend more time focussing on my career, and just not be in a relationship.

{"info":{"id":"t3_3zowgv","post":"It rained!!! (Guess where I'm from) I got my drivers permit about 2 months ago, bought a car two weeks later with my hard earned money from the summer. The car was shitty to others but a full blown race car to me. Looked like crap but ran like a champ. Anyways, I have never driven in the rain so I knew I'll run into trouble on my way back home from work. Hydro planing sounded familiar to me but never knew it's real consequences. Coming up to my turn where for a good mile (in Dominic torretto voice) I'm free. On the turn there was a huge size puddle of water. I tried to avoid it completly but knew and figured that the front right tire will hit the water. Remember that word \"hydroplane\", yeah I fucked up. The left front tire went over then sunk, causing me the turn into the side of the road. Closer to the edge, the water is deeper. My engine choked, I'm really fucked. Knew trying to keep turning the key will only make things worst. I got out, in ankle deep water, had the bitch in neutral and pushed to the corner of the turn. On the bright side of this whole predicament, a trucker got out of his rig and helped me push the water logged car to the edge. Once out of the water, I tried to give life to my racecar. Once she turned back on I booked it home. Ran the same as before except for a knocking noise. The noise just hurts thinking about it.

He said to her that I was \"kinda his girl thing but not really because he is afraid of commitment.\" Um, what?\n\nI confront him about this, he gets mad and says that was from a really long time ago. He says some rude things. It would have made since maybe 8 or 9 months ago, because that's what he would tell me. But it wasn't. It was from not even two months ago. He told me he loved me then, and told everyone I was girlfriend then. There was no confusion in our relationship then. We had even planned to move in together.\n\nI called him out on this and he said that \"unlike me\" he doesn't get hit on all the time and it feels good to talk to someone who gives him attention and who isn't always mad at him all the time.

{"info":{"id":"t3_2rwiht","post":"I've been with my boyfriend for 3+ years and I have started thinking about the future and marriage. One thing that bothers me sometimes is that I have been purposefully vague about my past relationships and I don't know if I need to open up to him and tell him everything. We are both quiet, introverted people that don't necessarily share every minute detail, so it hasn't been a big deal. \n\nI was in an emotionally abusive relationship in the past, and had a couple of short-term relationships after that where I was still emotionally unstable. I did some things I am not proud of (breaking up by no contact with one guy, dated another controlling man and then kissed someone else so we would break up) when I was younger. However, I've matured and learned about healthy relationships. I've been in 1-2 healthy relationships before I met my current boyfriend. Most people who know me now don't know any of this, and I an genuinely happy and fulfilled in my personal and professional life. It's only when I sometimes think back to the past I sort of freeze up inside.\n\nI have tried to see a couple of therapists (one after I ended the abusive relationship, and one a few years after that). But both of them stopped seeing me after a few sessions because I seemed pretty well-adjusted and was capable of dealing with the issues. I got some good advice about accepting myself and having healthy habits (exercise, eating well, sleeping well, etc.) to cope, but otherwise nothing major. The message I took away was that the past is in the past and I should work on the here and now. \n\nMy question is, do I need to tell my current boyfriend the entire truth? He knows about the abusive relationship (not the details, just that I was in one) and that I was \"wild\" in my youth (but again, not specifically what).

We had the best sex I have ever had in my life though. We've remained friends.\n\nThen I began to date this other guy, Tom. Tom and I were together for two and a half years. We lived together and everything was great until it wasn't anymore. He is 28 and I'm 25 and he just stopped being attracted to me I guess, because he would never try to sleep with me. I had to initiate everything and half the time he would reject me because he was on adderall or something. We didn't click sexually. In fact, when I told him how I wanted rough sex, he replied about how he \"isn't into rape\" and made me feel really shitty. I broke up with him last Thursday (it was very civil, he didn't try to get me to change my mind, it's very obvious he's no longer interested) and he is in the process of moving out.

Basically at some point during the night she started getting hit on by her boyfriend at the time's best friend who was sober. She was still a virgin and hadn't even slept with her boyfriend before but this guy convinced her to have sex with him.\nIn the morning she woke up in his shirt and barely remembered anything from the night before, but the fact that she had slept with the guy was fairly apparent. She asked him what had happened and if they even used protection but he wouldn't admit to anything. He wouldn't even say that they had sex. Soon after rumors circulated as they do in high school. She was always known as being incredibly innocent, hell she is a pastor's daughter, but now guys started asking her out of the blue if she would have sex with them if she was drunk. Also rumors got out that she was pregnant (she wasn't).\nAll this had a devastating impact on her self esteem and ego, meanwhile her boyfriend had gotten seriously depressed and was absolutely intolerable to deal with. The guy from the party started talking to her again. They met a few times under different circumstances, he would get her drunk, and have sex with her.\nShe left her boyfriend and soon after stopped seeing the other guy too.

{"info":{"id":"t3_fkqf1","post":"So I did some looking around at different models of wrist mount GPS units. Cost and functionality were the biggest concern. I finally decided on the Forerunner 305 since it would do everything I wanted and was a good price (even though it's huge).\n\nBest price I found online was through Amazon for around $130, with free shipping if I wanted to wait 1-2 weeks. It was available at the local Best Buy for $150. Did a quick search and found a printable coupon good for the month of February at Best Buy for 20% off all \"Health & Fitness\" products.\n\nWent in to Best Buy and the price was $160 on the shelf. I found an employee (just happened to be a cute girl) nearby and told her I wanted to get the 305. She said she had that model and loved it...even more than some of the more expensive ones she tried (even though it's huge). She said she has run some marathons and we chatted a little bit about how I was just starting to run. She told me about some of the runs in the area, how the best ones tend to end with beer, and overall was very pleasant and informative while waiting in line at the cashier. I definitely hope to meet more cool people like her while pursuing this sport.\n\nSo I got to the cashier and the 305 rang up at $160 as expected. I mentioned the web site price was $150 and he price matched it. Then I gave him the 20% off coupon and it wouldn't scan. He tried typing in the number and it wouldn't take it. So he tried again and it accepted the coupon, but didn't apply the discount to the 305. He read the coupon, looked at the GPS, manually entered the 20% off and had a supervisor approve it. Super easy, out the door for $120.\n\nThe coupon should work on any \"Garmin Fitness GPS\" (that's an actual category on the Best Buy website), as well as any heart rate monitor or other brand of fitness GPS.\n\nHere's a link to the coupon.

For the last month he insisted he didn't need to say \"I love you\" and we almost never had sex.

We had been there before because we have excellent sexual chemistry, but the romance wasn't there for YEARS.

We both achieved long-sought goals of physical fitness and he was a good motivator. The past two weeks he's been getting cozier. Four days ago he came over and we finally kissed again and we had a loooong talk. I explained that telling somebody you don't love them, and wont have sex with them, isn't a real relationship. He had many many emotional outbursts in the past, which I explained were totally unacceptable. \n\nThen he pulled what feels like a high school girl move and opened up about a dark secret (long story is he was taken advantage of by a Sugar Daddy who helped pay for college expenses and it had repercussions that manifested as intimacy issues). I told him I didn't really give a shit about it. I also told him that I'd be open to another attempt at a relationship but I wont call him my boyfriend or partner until \"It damn well feels like it\".

I created a throwaway because of too much personal detail in my main account. \n\nMy boyfriend and I are both grad students and have been together for four months now. I absolutely love him. He's sweet, caring, tolerant, liberal, basically every single thing on my 'checklist', if I had one, is there. \n\nThe problem, though, is he talks VERY slowly. I mean his speed is really slow. If I ask him anything, he takes about 3 seconds before he starts to talk, then when he starts, the words go at a very slow pace,and he even pauses for 3-5 seconds in the middle of his sentence. I get really impatient and sometimes just feel like telling him to hurry up (of course I don't, but I really feel like doing so). \n\nI asked him today, very gently, why he spoke so slow, and he said he just gets thoughts very slowly in his brain. He then went on to say he's just generally slow at thinking. I felt really sad when he said this, I don't know why. He's a Math PhD student,and we are at a pretty good school, and his research has been going slow for a while now (but this is totally normal in grad school), so I think that response was kind of a self-deprecating one since he's already low on self-esteem. \n\nAnyway, my point is, his speed of talking is just a part of him, it can't be changed. I love him so much otherwise but I just want to know how to deal with this. Conversation is so important in a relationship! How do we manage?

So now the problems, she only sits by the toilet when my Fiancee and I are around; She eats in front of me but only if I place the food in front of her and only stands up after extensive petting. She will immediately sit after I'm done petting as well. She's extremely jump and the tiniest noise causes her to curl into a ball and hide her head behind the toilet. She doesn't play, at least not with me, and a laser pointer causes her to go stroke mode and again, hide her head behind the toilet. She doesn't hiss at anything that I've found out yet.. So my question is, does my cat just need more time to get used to her space, and what can I do to get her to come out of her shell?

One thing that bothers me sometimes is that I have been purposefully vague about my past relationships and I don't know if I need to open up to him and tell him everything. We are both quiet, introverted people that don't necessarily share every minute detail, so it hasn't been a big deal. \n\nI was in an emotionally abusive relationship in the past, and had a couple of short-term relationships after that where I was still emotionally unstable. I did some things I am not proud of (breaking up by no contact with one guy, dated another controlling man and then kissed someone else so we would break up) when I was younger. However, I've matured and learned about healthy relationships. I've been in 1-2 healthy relationships before I met my current boyfriend. Most people who know me now don't know any of this, and I an genuinely happy and fulfilled in my personal and professional life. It's only when I sometimes think back to the past I sort of freeze up inside.\n\nI have tried to see a couple of therapists (one after I ended the abusive relationship, and one a few years after that). But both of them stopped seeing me after a few sessions because I seemed pretty well-adjusted and was capable of dealing with the issues. I got some good advice about accepting myself and having healthy habits (exercise, eating well, sleeping well, etc.) to cope, but otherwise nothing major. The message I took away was that the past is in the past and I should work on the here and now. \n\nMy question is, do I need to tell my current boyfriend the entire truth? He knows about the abusive relationship (not the details, just that I was in one) and that I was \"wild\" in my youth (but again, not specifically what). I am very happy in my current relationship, we are both supportive of each other, and this never comes up.

{"info":{"id":"t3_wx3g6","post":"Through my studies (bachelors), I have become more and more disturbed about the \"scientific\" nature of finance. \n\nQuick, what percentage of mutual funds \"beat the market\", i.e. perform better than the index? Studies generally find the number to be between 20 to 30 percent, but in 2011 the number went down to 14%. If these people are so armed with expertise and knowledge, why do people who don't understand anything about financial theory get more just by passively investing in an index fund? If anything, financial \"knowledge\" seems to do more harm than good.\n\nWhen looking at the stuff they teach in universities, you have to wonder how they keep on believing these theories despite the mountain of counterevidence. Stocks are assumed to generate returns relative to risk, quantified as beta in CAPM. Yet, beta has had almost zero correlation with stock returns starting in 1982. If you look at the studies that confirm beta's predictive power, they all used data from the 1970s. But people still use beta to create portfolios.\n\nHow about efficient market theory? Under the theory, stock bubbles should not exist since everythingn is properly priced. But they do exist. Instagram valued at 1 billion despite having no revenue? Definitely properly priced.\n\nEven option pricing models are ridiculous. One model assumes that you can borrow money at the risk-free rate and stocks only generate risk-free rate returns. The black-scholes model also assumes that risk is normally distributed, without looking at historical data, leading to black and scholes' own bankruptcy. \n\nWanna know how we price stocks? We pull magic numbers out of our asses and make it interact with other equally bullshit number to come up with an arbitrary value. Then we try to convince other people that our bullshit is, in fact, legit. The only way stock valuation models are accurate is if stock analysts are clairvoyant and can see 10 years into the future.

You Barry Powers?\"\n\"y-yeah..\" He managed to respond. \n\"oh, well, you have a sweet name!\" I said.\n\"ok..\" Mumbled Powers. Now, the next moment was like the end of an always sunny episode; my friends and I looked around and each other and decided, \"oh cool we did it, moving on now.\"\nIt was only a little bit later that we heard that this poor guy thought this was some massive hazing ritual the whole time.

{"info":{"id":"t3_fkqf1","post":"So I did some looking around at different models of wrist mount GPS units. Cost and functionality were the biggest concern. I finally decided on the Forerunner 305 since it would do everything I wanted and was a good price (even though it's huge).\n\nBest price I found online was through Amazon for around $130, with free shipping if I wanted to wait 1-2 weeks. It was available at the local Best Buy for $150. Did a quick search and found a printable coupon good for the month of February at Best Buy for 20% off all \"Health & Fitness\" products.\n\nWent in to Best Buy and the price was $160 on the shelf. I found an employee (just happened to be a cute girl) nearby and told her I wanted to get the 305. She said she had that model and loved it...even more than some of the more expensive ones she tried (even though it's huge). She said she has run some marathons and we chatted a little bit about how I was just starting to run. She told me about some of the runs in the area, how the best ones tend to end with beer, and overall was very pleasant and informative while waiting in line at the cashier. I definitely hope to meet more cool people like her while pursuing this sport.\n\nSo I got to the cashier and the 305 rang up at $160 as expected. I mentioned the web site price was $150 and he price matched it. Then I gave him the 20% off coupon and it wouldn't scan. He tried typing in the number and it wouldn't take it. So he tried again and it accepted the coupon, but didn't apply the discount to the 305. He read the coupon, looked at the GPS, manually entered the 20% off and had a supervisor approve it. Super easy, out the door for $120.\n\nThe coupon should work on any \"Garmin Fitness GPS\" (that's an actual category on the Best Buy website), as well as any heart rate monitor or other brand of fitness GPS.\n\nHere's a link to the coupon.

{"info":{"id":"t3_3mz0i7","post":"this applies to my current 1 year relationship with my bf but is more of a general question. I always hear over and over how lack of trust is the #1 dealbreaker in so many relationships, but I honestly feel like being reserved or holding back is just a smart move for alot of reasons. If for example my bf is out for the night and not responding to texts that's ok and I'm not going to interrogate him or go through his texts when I see him, I just mean in a more general sense, as in I feel being reserved and protecting myself\/not trusting him all the way is just the right thing to do generally. I have felt this way in all relationships I've ever had and I see no reason to change really. You never really know someone's true thoughts or feelings, and if you open up you are just going to get hurt, so why not enjoy your relationship while also protecting yourself on some level. He (or anybody else) will never have me completely but I don't think our relationship suffers for it.\n\nCan anyone explain why this is so important to many people? I am not a sociopath I swear, just cautious and I don't see why I should change, but it is a problem to other people I have dated. I feel you can enjoy relationships and love without a deep level of trust and it's not as important to me as it is to others.\n\nETA many are reacting negatively which is what I expected\/is unsurprising, I already know people get upset about this.

They started to come back every 4-6 weeks. I was referred to see a nephrologist. He diagnosed me with kidney disease after having an ultrasound and revealing I have seemingly one kidney. Left has grown to compensate for the right that seems to have not worked since birth. Also had what they said to be a \"small stone\" in the right kidney.\n\nI had then been referred to see a urologist if I got another UTI within the span of the next nephrologist visit. Well, I got one again. So I had a scheduled visit there before the nephrologist.\n\nThat was around June, 2016. Not much longer than a month, I had gotten sick from what seemed to be a stomach virus. All the symptoms. Lasted longer than 48 hours, which was strange. I had two ER visits due to pain and what I thought was bloody stool. CT scan revealed a cyst on my right ovary but that wasn't made a big deal.\n\nThen a GI doctor referral. She scheduled a multitude of tests for me. My stool sample test came back positive with C. Difficile toxin B. I am now taking Flagyl for this. 500 mg 3x a day. I have an endoscopy and colonoscopy October 3rd.\n\nToday, I've had a bit of pain in my lower abdomen very similar to what I would say UTI pain.

We really wanted to find this kid and congratulate him on his name.\nSo, after two weeks of this walking around and searching and asking, we ask someone about Mr. Powers and their answer is \"oh, he's right there.\"  we get freakin hyped and beeline to the dude, who looks at us with fear in his eyes. Thinking back on it, we had the poor kid, who was eating lunch on his own, in a corner surround by 4 of us. I asked, \"hey man. You Barry Powers?\"\n\"y-yeah..\" He managed to respond. \n\"oh, well, you have a sweet name!\" I said.\n\"ok..\" Mumbled Powers. Now, the next moment was like the end of an always sunny episode; my friends and I looked around and each other and decided, \"oh cool we did it, moving on now.\"\nIt was only a little bit later that we heard that this poor guy thought this was some massive hazing ritual the whole time. And since we had asked so many people, most of the freshman class thought here was some crazy hazing where we chose one random dude, hunted him down, and did something to him.

{"info":{"id":"t3_wx3g6","post":"Through my studies (bachelors), I have become more and more disturbed about the \"scientific\" nature of finance. \n\nQuick, what percentage of mutual funds \"beat the market\", i.e. perform better than the index? Studies generally find the number to be between 20 to 30 percent, but in 2011 the number went down to 14%. If these people are so armed with expertise and knowledge, why do people who don't understand anything about financial theory get more just by passively investing in an index fund? If anything, financial \"knowledge\" seems to do more harm than good.\n\nWhen looking at the stuff they teach in universities, you have to wonder how they keep on believing these theories despite the mountain of counterevidence. Stocks are assumed to generate returns relative to risk, quantified as beta in CAPM. Yet, beta has had almost zero correlation with stock returns starting in 1982. If you look at the studies that confirm beta's predictive power, they all used data from the 1970s. But people still use beta to create portfolios.\n\nHow about efficient market theory? Under the theory, stock bubbles should not exist since everythingn is properly priced. But they do exist. Instagram valued at 1 billion despite having no revenue? Definitely properly priced.\n\nEven option pricing models are ridiculous. One model assumes that you can borrow money at the risk-free rate and stocks only generate risk-free rate returns. The black-scholes model also assumes that risk is normally distributed, without looking at historical data, leading to black and scholes' own bankruptcy. \n\nWanna know how we price stocks? We pull magic numbers out of our asses and make it interact with other equally bullshit number to come up with an arbitrary value. Then we try to convince other people that our bullshit is, in fact, legit. The only way stock valuation models are accurate is if stock analysts are clairvoyant and can see 10 years into the future. But even then the analyst won't have to calculate anything and just tell us the stock price.","title":null,"subreddit":null},"split":"train","summaries":[{"text":" Is finance a pseudoscience?

We have lived together since almost the start of our relationship and have always been extremely close. One of our issues has always been sexual needs. We split up a couple of days ago over this because he met someone at work who he immediately wanted to fuck their brains out and felt guilty and like it wasn't fair to me.\n\nI explained to him tonight that every human in a relationship has these feelings at one time or another (correct me if I'm wrong). I too have wanted to fuck other people before but have never considered ending the relationship because of it. I feel like it's important these things remain sexual-only and no emotions involved which he has already stated would be the case with the current girl in question.\n\nHe also didn't have many other sexual partners before me so it's definitely coming into play. This situation is also something I have considered in the past without him (being polyamorous\/non- monogamous-not sure?) We have also discussed threesomes and such before.\n\nThe reason none of it has come to fruition before now is because of my own insecurities with my body. I'm trying to reach the point now of knowing its my only body and working it. I'm in the process of losing 30 lbs and have lost weight since we started dating. My weight has always been a strain on my sexual confidence especially in bed with him. \n\nSo on one hand I feel mostly okay with letting him fuck other women (and me fucking other men when I find someone appropriate) but I don't want to be jealous.

{"info":{"id":"t3_1c3dcm","post":"Hey everyone, I recently adopted a cat (about two weeks ago now) She's a 4 year old and is TINY. We set her up in the bathroom because we thought the small space would make it easier for her to transition. So now the problems, she only sits by the toilet when my Fiancee and I are around; She eats in front of me but only if I place the food in front of her and only stands up after extensive petting. She will immediately sit after I'm done petting as well. She's extremely jump and the tiniest noise causes her to curl into a ball and hide her head behind the toilet. She doesn't play, at least not with me, and a laser pointer causes her to go stroke mode and again, hide her head behind the toilet. She doesn't hiss at anything that I've found out yet.. So my question is, does my cat just need more time to get used to her space, and what can I do to get her to come out of her shell? Her history at the shelter says they found her as a new appearance in a Feral colony, so they thought she was a stray. I don't think she's feral because she lets you touch her (not pick her up; and bring your face even close to her is a nono...) She also hasn't tried to escape the house...or leave the bathroom at all (except one night when she tugged my electric shaver down and it caused her to run laps around the house.","title":null,"subreddit":null},"split":"train","summaries":[{"text":" Adopted a shy cat who is the biggest wuss I've ever met, I don't think she's feral, need HALP.","policy":null,"note":null},{"text":" Need help with adopted cat.","policy":null,"note":null}],"choice":0,"worker":4,"batch":"batch1","extra":{"expert_label":0,"reliability":"perfect","bias":"bias_coverage"}}

I received lots of advice to not make a major life decision while I was depressed, so we stayed together.

We have lived together since almost the start of our relationship and have always been extremely close. One of our issues has always been sexual needs. We split up a couple of days ago over this because he met someone at work who he immediately wanted to fuck their brains out and felt guilty and like it wasn't fair to me.\n\nI explained to him tonight that every human in a relationship has these feelings at one time or another (correct me if I'm wrong). I too have wanted to fuck other people before but have never considered ending the relationship because of it. I feel like it's important these things remain sexual-only and no emotions involved which he has already stated would be the case with the current girl in question.\n\nHe also didn't have many other sexual partners before me so it's definitely coming into play. This situation is also something I have considered in the past without him (being polyamorous\/non- monogamous-not sure?) We have also discussed threesomes and such before.\n\nThe reason none of it has come to fruition before now is because of my own insecurities with my body. I'm trying to reach the point now of knowing its my only body and working it. I'm in the process of losing 30 lbs and have lost weight since we started dating. My weight has always been a strain on my sexual confidence especially in bed with him. \n\nSo on one hand I feel mostly okay with letting him fuck other women (and me fucking other men when I find someone appropriate) but I don't want to be jealous. I have thought all of this out without getting emotional at all so it's all with a clear head. I want to have our amazing and awesome relationship as partners and still be open to other things.

Needless to say she trusted him as a friend.\n\nAnyway, once they were at her home he started making very aggressive advances including trying to remove her dress, kissing her & inappropriate touching. All the while she was saying 'Stop, this isn't right, you have a wife' etc. She made it quite clear about this. He continued and at one point he had removed his pants and was trying to get her to perform oral sex on him. Again she refused and he left shortly after. \n\nShe is extremely upset about this and doesn't want to report it to HR or the police as she doesn't want to relive it and would rather forget about it and try to move on, she believes this will give her closure. I can completely understand but to me the situation is much worse then she is giving off and this needs to be reported to their HR department at the very least.\n\nSince the night occurred she has only told a couple of friends (who do not know A) and me. One friend has told her not to do anything about it and says things like this happens, to me this is completely the wrong thing to say and trivialises the situation. \n\nAt the moment she is very upset and angry, (as am I, I feel by not being there I can't do anything) and would rather forget about what happened. I'm looking for a little guidance as to what I can do for her.

{"info":{"id":"t3_wx3g6","post":"Through my studies (bachelors), I have become more and more disturbed about the \"scientific\" nature of finance. \n\nQuick, what percentage of mutual funds \"beat the market\", i.e. perform better than the index? Studies generally find the number to be between 20 to 30 percent, but in 2011 the number went down to 14%. If these people are so armed with expertise and knowledge, why do people who don't understand anything about financial theory get more just by passively investing in an index fund? If anything, financial \"knowledge\" seems to do more harm than good.\n\nWhen looking at the stuff they teach in universities, you have to wonder how they keep on believing these theories despite the mountain of counterevidence. Stocks are assumed to generate returns relative to risk, quantified as beta in CAPM. Yet, beta has had almost zero correlation with stock returns starting in 1982. If you look at the studies that confirm beta's predictive power, they all used data from the 1970s. But people still use beta to create portfolios.\n\nHow about efficient market theory? Under the theory, stock bubbles should not exist since everythingn is properly priced. But they do exist. Instagram valued at 1 billion despite having no revenue? Definitely properly priced.\n\nEven option pricing models are ridiculous. One model assumes that you can borrow money at the risk-free rate and stocks only generate risk-free rate returns. The black-scholes model also assumes that risk is normally distributed, without looking at historical data, leading to black and scholes' own bankruptcy. \n\nWanna know how we price stocks? We pull magic numbers out of our asses and make it interact with other equally bullshit number to come up with an arbitrary value. Then we try to convince other people that our bullshit is, in fact, legit. The only way stock valuation models are accurate is if stock analysts are clairvoyant and can see 10 years into the future.

I ask why, she sais its personal, so i say ok, you dont have to tell me if u dont want, as long as you still talk to me.  she sais \"okies\"  and i guess i may have danced around it to see if she would let anything else out.  \"so what are you pregnant?\" lol gawd no etc etc.   well, i finally send her a last one saying to hmu if she wants to hang\/talk\/wtfever.  she didnt, and instead made open facebook posts about how happy she was and shit.  \n\nheres where i fucking blew it reddit:  seeing the fb posts i txted her \"hey u up? i wanna talk to u im gettin this wierd feeling that i missed my chance or somethin...\"\n\nits 730 am.  should i just go get drunk or something and try not to think about it? cuz im kinda stewing in what closely resembles highschool style rejection.","title":null,"subreddit":null},"split":"train","summaries":[{"text":" this girl has been meeting me, kissing me a lot, i think she met another dude, what can i do to help myself in this situation?","policy":null,"note":null},{"text":" I [24M] think i [22F] fucked it up, salvage advice\/confirmation of negligible potential sought","policy":null,"note":null}],"choice":0,"worker":4,"batch":"batch1","extra":{"expert_label":0,"reliability":"perfect","bias":"bias_coverage"}}

We lived together and everything was great until it wasn't anymore. He is 28 and I'm 25 and he just stopped being attracted to me I guess, because he would never try to sleep with me.

We have 3 dogs that are ours, and right now we're dogsitting for my sister (who adopted our first real rescue.) We're also dogsitting for a friend of ours who adopted 3 of our rescues who had to take an emergency business trip to Columbia (and no, not for that white powder type of business.)\n\nSo right now we have 7 dogs in our house, but we've done that once before and can handle it.\n\nThe real story comes from last summer, when we rescued a mom and her pup from the crawl space of a house that was due to be demolished later that week. We kept the pup, who is one of our core three, and the mom went to live with our friend, and is one of the 4 we're now dogsitting.\n\nThe mom is some kind of husky\/akita mix, but is relatively small for her size, coming in around 50 pounds.

He always gets upset at me for things that shouldn't be an issue at all (like wanting to go out and have a girls night). He spends his days sleeping and playing video games, he has no interest in working or working out or taking care of himself (or me). I feel like I'm scared to do anything because he always finds reasons to yell at me. I'm just not happy. He has told me multiple times that he doesn't trust me, and to a point I think he is very controlling (or tries to be). \n\nIt's hard. We live together, and have spent 99% of our time together for the last two years. I love him, and he loves me, but I just can't do this anymore. I need to experience being single and doing my own thing and having freedom. Maybe I am making a mistake and maybe I will regret letting go of someone who loves me, but the fact that I can't get these thoughts of breaking up out of my head is a big sign. \n\nWhat do I say? I don't want to hurt him. I've been putting this off because I don't want to have to go through the stress of one of us moving out or explaining to his parents (who treat me like a daughter).

I apologize if this post is kind of all over the place, but trying to quick explain the situation. \n\nMy FH and I are both military (LDR for 4 years) and stationed at different bases.  We have been talking marriage for over a year, planning on doing a simple backyard ceremony within the next year or two.  Fast forward to recent times, and he has gotten overseas orders, leaving in fall of this year.  I am unable to go with him unless we are married.  \n\nTo top it all off, I was recently deployed for 6 months, and at the end of my deployment, my FH deployed to a different area.  By the time he gets back (late spring) it will have been a year since we've seen each other. \n\nAnyway, after discussion, we have decided to get married before he goes overseas.  Then, either I can try to apply to get orders with him, or I will be eligible to go be with him after my contract is up next year. \n\nHe is coming to visit me after he gets back from his deployment, and we have been discussing doing a court house marriage at that time.  The problem with this, is that both of our families would not be able to make it at that time (both his dad and my grandma are dealing with serious illnesses at this time).  We do not want to disappoint our families by getting married without them, but we absolutely cannot wait on the marriage due to the military. \n\nSo now for the advice....would we be terrible people for eloping\/doing a court house wedding by ourselves....but only announcing engagement to everyone at that time?

I eventually left my husband for him, but things fizzled before they truly began because he's mentally unstable and he became a danger to himself and others.\n\nSince then my husband and I have been working things out between us (there were deep issues we had before the affair that drove us apart) and it's actually going quite well.

The car was shitty to others but a full blown race car to me. Looked like crap but ran like a champ. Anyways, I have never driven in the rain so I knew I'll run into trouble on my way back home from work. Hydro planing sounded familiar to me but never knew it's real consequences. Coming up to my turn where for a good mile (in Dominic torretto voice) I'm free. On the turn there was a huge size puddle of water. I tried to avoid it completly but knew and figured that the front right tire will hit the water. Remember that word \"hydroplane\", yeah I fucked up. The left front tire went over then sunk, causing me the turn into the side of the road. Closer to the edge, the water is deeper. My engine choked, I'm really fucked. Knew trying to keep turning the key will only make things worst. I got out, in ankle deep water, had the bitch in neutral and pushed to the corner of the turn. On the bright side of this whole predicament, a trucker got out of his rig and helped me push the water logged car to the edge. Once out of the water, I tried to give life to my racecar. Once she turned back on I booked it home. Ran the same as before except for a knocking noise. The noise just hurts thinking about it.

However, I noticed that almost immediately (within like 2 weeks) after we broke up this guy she met from a club started hitting on her. She claims to have no attraction towards him but anyone with a pair of eyes can see there's a mutual attraction. Now I don't like this guy because he was hitting on her while we were still dating. I just got onto Facebook today to see her and a picture of him together celebrating his 21st birthday.\n\nI know I'm the one that broke it off and it's my fault for doing so, but I can't help but feel...betrayed?

We set her up in the bathroom because we thought the small space would make it easier for her to transition. So now the problems, she only sits by the toilet when my Fiancee and I are around; She eats in front of me but only if I place the food in front of her and only stands up after extensive petting. She will immediately sit after I'm done petting as well. She's extremely jump and the tiniest noise causes her to curl into a ball and hide her head behind the toilet. She doesn't play, at least not with me, and a laser pointer causes her to go stroke mode and again, hide her head behind the toilet. She doesn't hiss at anything that I've found out yet..

Harvey said I can come skate one day with a smaller group a friends another day. I didn't ask any questions, and just said okay. It really hurt my feelings at the time, but I'm over it now. This was a week ago\n\nHarvey came into my store yesterday, and apologized for what happened. He felt really bad.

{"info":{"id":"t3_wx3g6","post":"Through my studies (bachelors), I have become more and more disturbed about the \"scientific\" nature of finance. \n\nQuick, what percentage of mutual funds \"beat the market\", i.e. perform better than the index? Studies generally find the number to be between 20 to 30 percent, but in 2011 the number went down to 14%. If these people are so armed with expertise and knowledge, why do people who don't understand anything about financial theory get more just by passively investing in an index fund? If anything, financial \"knowledge\" seems to do more harm than good.\n\nWhen looking at the stuff they teach in universities, you have to wonder how they keep on believing these theories despite the mountain of counterevidence. Stocks are assumed to generate returns relative to risk, quantified as beta in CAPM. Yet, beta has had almost zero correlation with stock returns starting in 1982. If you look at the studies that confirm beta's predictive power, they all used data from the 1970s. But people still use beta to create portfolios.\n\nHow about efficient market theory? Under the theory, stock bubbles should not exist since everythingn is properly priced. But they do exist. Instagram valued at 1 billion despite having no revenue? Definitely properly priced.\n\nEven option pricing models are ridiculous. One model assumes that you can borrow money at the risk-free rate and stocks only generate risk-free rate returns. The black-scholes model also assumes that risk is normally distributed, without looking at historical data, leading to black and scholes' own bankruptcy. \n\nWanna know how we price stocks? We pull magic numbers out of our asses and make it interact with other equally bullshit number to come up with an arbitrary value. Then we try to convince other people that our bullshit is, in fact, legit. The only way stock valuation models are accurate is if stock analysts are clairvoyant and can see 10 years into the future. But even then the analyst won't have to calculate anything and just tell us the stock price.","title":null,"subreddit":null},"split":"train","summaries":[{"text":" I'm not sure finance is a science.

He had an awesome name. Idk how i can make something comparable.. We'll call him Barry Powers. It wad like that, a superhero type name. So anyway, we heard the name Barry Powers during freshman roll call and we were like \"damn! What a sick name!\" And made it our ultimate mission to find this guy.\nAnd so we searched.\nIt took weeks. \nWhenever we met other freshmen, we asked, \"do you know Barry Powers?\" And other questions like \"what does he look like?\", \"where did you last see him?\", and \"where can we find him?\".  We really wanted to find this kid and congratulate him on his name.\nSo, after two weeks of this walking around and searching and asking, we ask someone about Mr. Powers and their answer is \"oh, he's right there.\"  we get freakin hyped and beeline to the dude, who looks at us with fear in his eyes. Thinking back on it, we had the poor kid, who was eating lunch on his own, in a corner surround by 4 of us. I asked, \"hey man. You Barry Powers?\"\n\"y-yeah..\" He managed to respond. \n\"oh, well, you have a sweet name!\" I said.\n\"ok..\" Mumbled Powers.

The house was rebuilt brand new within the past few years, and we knew we just had to have it when we saw it. The process has been relatively painless up to this point, including the resolution of several things from the home inspection process.\n\nFast forward to yesterday: law office sends over a correspondence letting us know that one of the sellers has died, but the remaining spouse still intends to move forward with the sale. Instant remorse and sorrow set in; despite hardly knowing the person. Then my wife brings up a valid point: what if the person died in the house? Will we still be comfortable to move forward ourselves, given that knowledge? I dismissed this, figuring hey the sellers are young, it probably was an accident of some sort (not trying to sound insensitive here, just trying to get my point across).\n\nI spoke to our lawyer last night, and basically was told that we are in a binding contract, and (barring a homicide or wrongful death in the house of sorts) would need to move forward so long as the seller wishes to move forward.

Compliments are slowed down as well.\n\nWhile this could be due to outside reasons (he's taking 3 online classes over the summer and working more), part of me is taking wisdom from \"He's Just Not That Into You\" and thinking that if the guy really liked me, he would make more of an effort like he used to- I mean shit...it's been only like 2 months, little early to get bored in a relationship. \n\nThe other day I asked him straight up if he was still interested in pursuing a relationship with me and he seemed taken aback that I thought otherwise.

We have lived together since almost the start of our relationship and have always been extremely close. One of our issues has always been sexual needs. We split up a couple of days ago over this because he met someone at work who he immediately wanted to fuck their brains out and felt guilty and like it wasn't fair to me.\n\nI explained to him tonight that every human in a relationship has these feelings at one time or another (correct me if I'm wrong). I too have wanted to fuck other people before but have never considered ending the relationship because of it. I feel like it's important these things remain sexual-only and no emotions involved which he has already stated would be the case with the current girl in question.\n\nHe also didn't have many other sexual partners before me so it's definitely coming into play. This situation is also something I have considered in the past without him (being polyamorous\/non- monogamous-not sure?) We have also discussed threesomes and such before.\n\nThe reason none of it has come to fruition before now is because of my own insecurities with my body. I'm trying to reach the point now of knowing its my only body and working it. I'm in the process of losing 30 lbs and have lost weight since we started dating. My weight has always been a strain on my sexual confidence especially in bed with him. \n\nSo on one hand I feel mostly okay with letting him fuck other women (and me fucking other men when I find someone appropriate) but I don't want to be jealous.

One thing that bothers me sometimes is that I have been purposefully vague about my past relationships and I don't know if I need to open up to him and tell him everything. We are both quiet, introverted people that don't necessarily share every minute detail, so it hasn't been a big deal. \n\nI was in an emotionally abusive relationship in the past, and had a couple of short-term relationships after that where I was still emotionally unstable. I did some things I am not proud of (breaking up by no contact with one guy, dated another controlling man and then kissed someone else so we would break up) when I was younger. However, I've matured and learned about healthy relationships. I've been in 1-2 healthy relationships before I met my current boyfriend. Most people who know me now don't know any of this, and I an genuinely happy and fulfilled in my personal and professional life. It's only when I sometimes think back to the past I sort of freeze up inside.\n\nI have tried to see a couple of therapists (one after I ended the abusive relationship, and one a few years after that). But both of them stopped seeing me after a few sessions because I seemed pretty well-adjusted and was capable of dealing with the issues. I got some good advice about accepting myself and having healthy habits (exercise, eating well, sleeping well, etc.) to cope, but otherwise nothing major. The message I took away was that the past is in the past and I should work on the here and now. \n\nMy question is, do I need to tell my current boyfriend the entire truth? He knows about the abusive relationship (not the details, just that I was in one) and that I was \"wild\" in my youth (but again, not specifically what).

He said to her that I was \"kinda his girl thing but not really because he is afraid of commitment.\" Um, what?\n\nI confront him about this, he gets mad and says that was from a really long time ago. He says some rude things. It would have made since maybe 8 or 9 months ago, because that's what he would tell me. But it wasn't. It was from not even two months ago.

Studies generally find the number to be between 20 to 30 percent, but in 2011 the number went down to 14%. If these people are so armed with expertise and knowledge, why do people who don't understand anything about financial theory get more just by passively investing in an index fund? If anything, financial \"knowledge\" seems to do more harm than good.\n\nWhen looking at the stuff they teach in universities, you have to wonder how they keep on believing these theories despite the mountain of counterevidence. Stocks are assumed to generate returns relative to risk, quantified as beta in CAPM. Yet, beta has had almost zero correlation with stock returns starting in 1982. If you look at the studies that confirm beta's predictive power, they all used data from the 1970s. But people still use beta to create portfolios.\n\nHow about efficient market theory? Under the theory, stock bubbles should not exist since everythingn is properly priced. But they do exist. Instagram valued at 1 billion despite having no revenue? Definitely properly priced.\n\nEven option pricing models are ridiculous. One model assumes that you can borrow money at the risk-free rate and stocks only generate risk-free rate returns. The black-scholes model also assumes that risk is normally distributed, without looking at historical data, leading to black and scholes' own bankruptcy. \n\nWanna know how we price stocks? We pull magic numbers out of our asses and make it interact with other equally bullshit number to come up with an arbitrary value. Then we try to convince other people that our bullshit is, in fact, legit. The only way stock valuation models are accurate is if stock analysts are clairvoyant and can see 10 years into the future.

I had told her I was looking for more than a hookup, and she said the same. She kept telling me how self conscious she is of her body, how much weight she's gained, and would send me pics of her asking if I was okay with her body.

We had a great time together. Spent about 10 hours in total, including some heavy making out and fooling around. The problem is, she's a lot heavier than I had been anticipating. So much so, that I am just not that attracted to her, and had trouble staying hard when we were fooling around.\n\nWe didn't have sex, because she said she wanted to wait until we were \"official\" as if it was inevitable (and I'll admit, through texting, I thought it was inevitable as well).

There is no sick time, no personal time, the building itself is not well-maintained, and there is nowhere to move up in the company.

I live with my SO and am lucky to have very low expenses (<$500\/mo) I've managed to save around 15k in the time I've been there.

{"info":{"id":"t3_wx3g6","post":"Through my studies (bachelors), I have become more and more disturbed about the \"scientific\" nature of finance. \n\nQuick, what percentage of mutual funds \"beat the market\", i.e. perform better than the index? Studies generally find the number to be between 20 to 30 percent, but in 2011 the number went down to 14%. If these people are so armed with expertise and knowledge, why do people who don't understand anything about financial theory get more just by passively investing in an index fund? If anything, financial \"knowledge\" seems to do more harm than good.\n\nWhen looking at the stuff they teach in universities, you have to wonder how they keep on believing these theories despite the mountain of counterevidence. Stocks are assumed to generate returns relative to risk, quantified as beta in CAPM. Yet, beta has had almost zero correlation with stock returns starting in 1982. If you look at the studies that confirm beta's predictive power, they all used data from the 1970s. But people still use beta to create portfolios.\n\nHow about efficient market theory? Under the theory, stock bubbles should not exist since everythingn is properly priced. But they do exist. Instagram valued at 1 billion despite having no revenue? Definitely properly priced.\n\nEven option pricing models are ridiculous. One model assumes that you can borrow money at the risk-free rate and stocks only generate risk-free rate returns. The black-scholes model also assumes that risk is normally distributed, without looking at historical data, leading to black and scholes' own bankruptcy. \n\nWanna know how we price stocks? We pull magic numbers out of our asses and make it interact with other equally bullshit number to come up with an arbitrary value. Then we try to convince other people that our bullshit is, in fact, legit. The only way stock valuation models are accurate is if stock analysts are clairvoyant and can see 10 years into the future.

The house was rebuilt brand new within the past few years, and we knew we just had to have it when we saw it. The process has been relatively painless up to this point, including the resolution of several things from the home inspection process.\n\nFast forward to yesterday: law office sends over a correspondence letting us know that one of the sellers has died, but the remaining spouse still intends to move forward with the sale. Instant remorse and sorrow set in; despite hardly knowing the person. Then my wife brings up a valid point: what if the person died in the house? Will we still be comfortable to move forward ourselves, given that knowledge? I dismissed this, figuring hey the sellers are young, it probably was an accident of some sort (not trying to sound insensitive here, just trying to get my point across).\n\nI spoke to our lawyer last night, and basically was told that we are in a binding contract, and (barring a homicide or wrongful death in the house of sorts) would need to move forward so long as the seller wishes to move forward. Outside of this, we would need to involve a litigator, and that will create a huge headache I an sure.\n\nNow, we just found out that the seller did indeed die in the house (suddenly).\n\nI don't know how to feel or what to think.

{"info":{"id":"t3_fkqf1","post":"So I did some looking around at different models of wrist mount GPS units. Cost and functionality were the biggest concern. I finally decided on the Forerunner 305 since it would do everything I wanted and was a good price (even though it's huge).\n\nBest price I found online was through Amazon for around $130, with free shipping if I wanted to wait 1-2 weeks. It was available at the local Best Buy for $150. Did a quick search and found a printable coupon good for the month of February at Best Buy for 20% off all \"Health & Fitness\" products.\n\nWent in to Best Buy and the price was $160 on the shelf. I found an employee (just happened to be a cute girl) nearby and told her I wanted to get the 305. She said she had that model and loved it...even more than some of the more expensive ones she tried (even though it's huge). She said she has run some marathons and we chatted a little bit about how I was just starting to run. She told me about some of the runs in the area, how the best ones tend to end with beer, and overall was very pleasant and informative while waiting in line at the cashier. I definitely hope to meet more cool people like her while pursuing this sport.\n\nSo I got to the cashier and the 305 rang up at $160 as expected. I mentioned the web site price was $150 and he price matched it. Then I gave him the 20% off coupon and it wouldn't scan. He tried typing in the number and it wouldn't take it. So he tried again and it accepted the coupon, but didn't apply the discount to the 305. He read the coupon, looked at the GPS, manually entered the 20% off and had a supervisor approve it.

He had an awesome name. Idk how i can make something comparable.. We'll call him Barry Powers. It wad like that, a superhero type name. So anyway, we heard the name Barry Powers during freshman roll call and we were like \"damn! What a sick name!\" And made it our ultimate mission to find this guy.\nAnd so we searched.\nIt took weeks. \nWhenever we met other freshmen, we asked, \"do you know Barry Powers?\" And other questions like \"what does he look like?\", \"where did you last see him?\", and \"where can we find him?\".  We really wanted to find this kid and congratulate him on his name.\nSo, after two weeks of this walking around and searching and asking, we ask someone about Mr. Powers and their answer is \"oh, he's right there.\"  we get freakin hyped and beeline to the dude, who looks at us with fear in his eyes. Thinking back on it, we had the poor kid, who was eating lunch on his own, in a corner surround by 4 of us. I asked, \"hey man. You Barry Powers?\"\n\"y-yeah..\" He managed to respond. \n\"oh, well, you have a sweet name!\" I said.\n\"ok..\" Mumbled Powers.

{"info":{"id":"t3_wx3g6","post":"Through my studies (bachelors), I have become more and more disturbed about the \"scientific\" nature of finance. \n\nQuick, what percentage of mutual funds \"beat the market\", i.e. perform better than the index? Studies generally find the number to be between 20 to 30 percent, but in 2011 the number went down to 14%. If these people are so armed with expertise and knowledge, why do people who don't understand anything about financial theory get more just by passively investing in an index fund? If anything, financial \"knowledge\" seems to do more harm than good.\n\nWhen looking at the stuff they teach in universities, you have to wonder how they keep on believing these theories despite the mountain of counterevidence. Stocks are assumed to generate returns relative to risk, quantified as beta in CAPM. Yet, beta has had almost zero correlation with stock returns starting in 1982. If you look at the studies that confirm beta's predictive power, they all used data from the 1970s. But people still use beta to create portfolios.\n\nHow about efficient market theory? Under the theory, stock bubbles should not exist since everythingn is properly priced. But they do exist. Instagram valued at 1 billion despite having no revenue? Definitely properly priced.\n\nEven option pricing models are ridiculous. One model assumes that you can borrow money at the risk-free rate and stocks only generate risk-free rate returns. The black-scholes model also assumes that risk is normally distributed, without looking at historical data, leading to black and scholes' own bankruptcy. \n\nWanna know how we price stocks? We pull magic numbers out of our asses and make it interact with other equally bullshit number to come up with an arbitrary value. Then we try to convince other people that our bullshit is, in fact, legit. The only way stock valuation models are accurate is if stock analysts are clairvoyant and can see 10 years into the future. But even then the analyst won't have to calculate anything and just tell us the stock price.","title":null,"subreddit":null},"split":"train","summaries":[{"text":" Is finance a pseudoscience?

During that time I never hit on him even though I felt attracted to him because of my relationship. When that relationship ended, he was one of the people who helped me get back on my feet and even went with me on a holiday because the ex (25 M) and I planned it out before breaking up.

The red flag I should have noticed is he refuses to be Facebook friends or even let me follow his Twitter as he's following mine.

They started to come back every 4-6 weeks. I was referred to see a nephrologist. He diagnosed me with kidney disease after having an ultrasound and revealing I have seemingly one kidney. Left has grown to compensate for the right that seems to have not worked since birth. Also had what they said to be a \"small stone\" in the right kidney.\n\nI had then been referred to see a urologist if I got another UTI within the span of the next nephrologist visit.

All the symptoms. Lasted longer than 48 hours, which was strange. I had two ER visits due to pain and what I thought was bloody stool. CT scan revealed a cyst on my right ovary but that wasn't made a big deal.\n\nThen a GI doctor referral. She scheduled a multitude of tests for me. My stool sample test came back positive with C. Difficile toxin B. I am now taking Flagyl for this. 500 mg 3x a day. I have an endoscopy and colonoscopy October 3rd.\n\nToday, I've had a bit of pain in my lower abdomen very similar to what I would say UTI pain.

Today, we finally met up. \n\nBefore I get into that, let me just say that while texting, she sort of fell for me. I like her, too, but still, I hadn't met her so I didn't know how much. I had told her I was looking for more than a hookup, and she said the same. She kept telling me how self conscious she is of her body, how much weight she's gained, and would send me pics of her asking if I was okay with her body. In the pics she sent me, she did seem a little chubby, but still very cute. I reassured her that I found her attractive, because from the pics, I really did.\n\nOn to our date. We had a great time together. Spent about 10 hours in total, including some heavy making out and fooling around. The problem is, she's a lot heavier than I had been anticipating. So much so, that I am just not that attracted to her, and had trouble staying hard when we were fooling around.\n\nWe didn't have sex, because she said she wanted to wait until we were \"official\" as if it was inevitable (and I'll admit, through texting, I thought it was inevitable as well). I just don't know what to do. She's already asking me what to do for our next date, and talking about future plans together, and I'm just kind of going along with it because I'm terrified of hurting an already very self-conscious person. She's such a nice girl, and I feel like if I told her I wasn't feeling it, it would just destroy her. She told me it was the best date she's ever had, and one of the best days of her life.

The left front tire went over then sunk, causing me the turn into the side of the road. Closer to the edge, the water is deeper. My engine choked, I'm really fucked. Knew trying to keep turning the key will only make things worst. I got out, in ankle deep water, had the bitch in neutral and pushed to the corner of the turn. On the bright side of this whole predicament, a trucker got out of his rig and helped me push the water logged car to the edge. Once out of the water, I tried to give life to my racecar.

Thinking back on it, we had the poor kid, who was eating lunch on his own, in a corner surround by 4 of us. I asked, \"hey man. You Barry Powers?\"\n\"y-yeah..\" He managed to respond. \n\"oh, well, you have a sweet name!\" I said.\n\"ok..\" Mumbled Powers. Now, the next moment was like the end of an always sunny episode; my friends and I looked around and each other and decided, \"oh cool we did it, moving on now.\"\nIt was only a little bit later that we heard that this poor guy thought this was some massive hazing ritual the whole time.

{"info":{"id":"t3_49nwvy","post":"What are my options in relation to changes being made to my employment contract? Can I refuse to sign something I did not agree to without it affecting my employment?\n\nBackground:\nMy employer pays for our exams and training. It has not been stated that we would need to repay these costs until recently. It was announced last month  (2 days after I booked my next exam) that we would be liable to repay costs in the event we leave the company within 36 months of the cost being incurred. Today we have been given a document stating it's an amendment to our contract amednmnd the changes are to be implemented immediately.\n\nMy problem is I have an interview lined up 31 March. I've had a first interview with the company (1 march) and they have called me back for a second interview. \n\nI calculate the costs I would owe my current employer as \u00a3530. I only earn \u00a31,106 at present and cannot afford to lose that amount from my pay or I cannot afford to pay my half of the bills\/rent and my SO wouldn't have the available funds to help me out.\n\nCan I refuse to sign this document?

But on the other hand, the interview is promising (I have a friend at the company and the Directors I've already met have apparently gone up to her and told her how impressed hey were... so I'm hopeful).\n\nI think that's enough info.... but happy to expand if necessary.

I am only 18 and he's 25, although I have moved out of home and support myself. We talk all day, every day, calling or facetiming pretty much every night. He really, really likes me but the problem is I don't like him as much. It was all fine, until recently I mentioned how it sucks I'll never see him. Fast-forward a couple of days and he tells me he has found a super cheap plane ticket to the city I live in. He asks if I would be open to him coming to visit and not really thinking or wanting to hurt his feelings I said of course! He bought it right then and there and now I am scared. As time goes on my attraction to him is fading and I can see that he mainly likes me because I am his ideal 'perfect girl'. He is not my perfect guy, I do not want to commit to him and I am not sure if I even have feelings for him. If it weren't for the plane ticket I would probably stop talking to him as to not lead him on but now I have this paralyzing guilt that he has spent all this money to come see me and I don't even want him to.

You Barry Powers?\"\n\"y-yeah..\" He managed to respond. \n\"oh, well, you have a sweet name!\" I said.\n\"ok..\" Mumbled Powers.

I went to a therapist (which I'm still seeing) and I'm doing much better, so now I have a job at Sears.\n\nI'm thankful for my job, but I'm 25 going to be 26 in May and I'm still living with my parents. I've been trying to save money, but I have a $450 monthly bill that I have to pay for that alt cert program. Luckily, May will be the last month I have to pay on that. I've been trying to apply to teach English abroad, but I just got rejected by EPIK, so I don't think that's going to work out.\n\nI just don't want to work in retail anymore. I'm not saying that retail is all bad, but I just want something a little more. But now I feel like this is all I can do right now. I'm starting to feel like I'm only qualified for retail. No other area will hire me. I've been looking for jobs out of state (I live in Louisiana), but I can't afford to move out yet (despite me desperately wanting to).

He really, really likes me but the problem is I don't like him as much. It was all fine, until recently I mentioned how it sucks I'll never see him.

The guy from the party started talking to her again. They met a few times under different circumstances, he would get her drunk, and have sex with her.\nShe left her boyfriend and soon after stopped seeing the other guy too.

They started to come back every 4-6 weeks. I was referred to see a nephrologist. He diagnosed me with kidney disease after having an ultrasound and revealing I have seemingly one kidney. Left has grown to compensate for the right that seems to have not worked since birth. Also had what they said to be a \"small stone\" in the right kidney.\n\nI had then been referred to see a urologist if I got another UTI within the span of the next nephrologist visit. Well, I got one again. So I had a scheduled visit there before the nephrologist.\n\nThat was around June, 2016. Not much longer than a month, I had gotten sick from what seemed to be a stomach virus. All the symptoms. Lasted longer than 48 hours, which was strange. I had two ER visits due to pain and what I thought was bloody stool. CT scan revealed a cyst on my right ovary but that wasn't made a big deal.\n\nThen a GI doctor referral. She scheduled a multitude of tests for me. My stool sample test came back positive with C. Difficile toxin B. I am now taking Flagyl for this. 500 mg 3x a day. I have an endoscopy and colonoscopy October 3rd.\n\nToday, I've had a bit of pain in my lower abdomen very similar to what I would say UTI pain. I've had burning sensations when I've gone to the bathroom, too. I'm a bit worried and was wondering if I should see my urologist.

{"info":{"id":"t3_fkqf1","post":"So I did some looking around at different models of wrist mount GPS units. Cost and functionality were the biggest concern. I finally decided on the Forerunner 305 since it would do everything I wanted and was a good price (even though it's huge).\n\nBest price I found online was through Amazon for around $130, with free shipping if I wanted to wait 1-2 weeks. It was available at the local Best Buy for $150. Did a quick search and found a printable coupon good for the month of February at Best Buy for 20% off all \"Health & Fitness\" products.\n\nWent in to Best Buy and the price was $160 on the shelf. I found an employee (just happened to be a cute girl) nearby and told her I wanted to get the 305. She said she had that model and loved it...even more than some of the more expensive ones she tried (even though it's huge). She said she has run some marathons and we chatted a little bit about how I was just starting to run. She told me about some of the runs in the area, how the best ones tend to end with beer, and overall was very pleasant and informative while waiting in line at the cashier. I definitely hope to meet more cool people like her while pursuing this sport.\n\nSo I got to the cashier and the 305 rang up at $160 as expected. I mentioned the web site price was $150 and he price matched it. Then I gave him the 20% off coupon and it wouldn't scan. He tried typing in the number and it wouldn't take it. So he tried again and it accepted the coupon, but didn't apply the discount to the 305. He read the coupon, looked at the GPS, manually entered the 20% off and had a supervisor approve it. Super easy, out the door for $120.\n\nThe coupon should work on any \"Garmin Fitness GPS\" (that's an actual category on the Best Buy website), as well as any heart rate monitor or other brand of fitness GPS.\n\nHere's a link to the coupon.

He had an awesome name. Idk how i can make something comparable.. We'll call him Barry Powers. It wad like that, a superhero type name. So anyway, we heard the name Barry Powers during freshman roll call and we were like \"damn! What a sick name!\" And made it our ultimate mission to find this guy.\nAnd so we searched.\nIt took weeks. \nWhenever we met other freshmen, we asked, \"do you know Barry Powers?\" And other questions like \"what does he look like?\", \"where did you last see him?\", and \"where can we find him?\".  We really wanted to find this kid and congratulate him on his name.\nSo, after two weeks of this walking around and searching and asking, we ask someone about Mr. Powers and their answer is \"oh, he's right there.\"  we get freakin hyped and beeline to the dude, who looks at us with fear in his eyes. Thinking back on it, we had the poor kid, who was eating lunch on his own, in a corner surround by 4 of us. I asked, \"hey man. You Barry Powers?\"\n\"y-yeah..\" He managed to respond. \n\"oh, well, you have a sweet name!\" I said.\n\"ok..\" Mumbled Powers. Now, the next moment was like the end of an always sunny episode; my friends and I looked around and each other and decided, \"oh cool we did it, moving on now.\"\nIt was only a little bit later that we heard that this poor guy thought this was some massive hazing ritual the whole time.

He really, really likes me but the problem is I don't like him as much. It was all fine, until recently I mentioned how it sucks I'll never see him.

As time goes on my attraction to him is fading and I can see that he mainly likes me because I am his ideal 'perfect girl'. He is not my perfect guy, I do not want to commit to him and I am not sure if I even have feelings for him. If it weren't for the plane ticket I would probably stop talking to him as to not lead him on but now I have this paralyzing guilt that he has spent all this money to come see me and I don't even want him to. I feel like when he gets here I'm going to have to put on this huge facade, because I don't want to hurt his feelings. It takes every ounce of patience within me not to lose it with him when he's being annoying eg- going on about how well traveled he is (keep in mind I have visited 10+ countries, 5 of which on my own. He has never been outside of the Americas), how cool he is, and how so many girls want him. To be honest I feel almost no sexual attraction anymore and it's becoming overwhelming keeping up with this lie.

He always gets upset at me for things that shouldn't be an issue at all (like wanting to go out and have a girls night). He spends his days sleeping and playing video games, he has no interest in working or working out or taking care of himself (or me).

So anyway, we heard the name Barry Powers during freshman roll call and we were like \"damn! What a sick name!\" And made it our ultimate mission to find this guy.\nAnd so we searched.\nIt took weeks. \nWhenever we met other freshmen, we asked, \"do you know Barry Powers?\" And other questions like \"what does he look like?\", \"where did you last see him?\", and \"where can we find him?\".

Thinking back on it, we had the poor kid, who was eating lunch on his own, in a corner surround by 4 of us. I asked, \"hey man. You Barry Powers?\"\n\"y-yeah..\" He managed to respond. \n\"oh, well, you have a sweet name!\" I said.\n\"ok..\" Mumbled Powers. Now, the next moment was like the end of an always sunny episode; my friends and I looked around and each other and decided, \"oh cool we did it, moving on now.\"\nIt was only a little bit later that we heard that this poor guy thought this was some massive hazing ritual the whole time.

{"info":{"id":"t3_2p6bmu","post":"In September my boyfriend of 10 months (Bart) broke up with me. We had been fighting almost all summer and it was a long, heartbreaking process. For the last month he insisted he didn't need to say \"I love you\" and we almost never had sex. Awful. \n\nAbout a month later my ex (Steve) from less than an hour away just dumped his ex and we entered a sort of FWB situation. We had been there before because we have excellent sexual chemistry, but the romance wasn't there for YEARS. Now, after a month, the first ex (Bart) and I exchanged letters and we agreed to a friendship, he started going to the gym with me and it was a really good. We both achieved long-sought goals of physical fitness and he was a good motivator. The past two weeks he's been getting cozier. Four days ago he came over and we finally kissed again and we had a loooong talk. I explained that telling somebody you don't love them, and wont have sex with them, isn't a real relationship. He had many many emotional outbursts in the past, which I explained were totally unacceptable. \n\nThen he pulled what feels like a high school girl move and opened up about a dark secret (long story is he was taken advantage of by a Sugar Daddy who helped pay for college expenses and it had repercussions that manifested as intimacy issues). I told him I didn't really give a shit about it. I also told him that I'd be open to another attempt at a relationship but I wont call him my boyfriend or partner until \"It damn well feels like it\". Maybe that wasn't fair of me. \n\nSo here I am, between two boys. The FWB (Steve) needs to be made aware because we established an exclusive sexual relationship for health reasons.

During that time I never hit on him even though I felt attracted to him because of my relationship. When that relationship ended, he was one of the people who helped me get back on my feet and even went with me on a holiday because the ex (25 M) and I planned it out before breaking up.

{"info":{"id":"t3_wx3g6","post":"Through my studies (bachelors), I have become more and more disturbed about the \"scientific\" nature of finance. \n\nQuick, what percentage of mutual funds \"beat the market\", i.e. perform better than the index? Studies generally find the number to be between 20 to 30 percent, but in 2011 the number went down to 14%. If these people are so armed with expertise and knowledge, why do people who don't understand anything about financial theory get more just by passively investing in an index fund? If anything, financial \"knowledge\" seems to do more harm than good.\n\nWhen looking at the stuff they teach in universities, you have to wonder how they keep on believing these theories despite the mountain of counterevidence. Stocks are assumed to generate returns relative to risk, quantified as beta in CAPM. Yet, beta has had almost zero correlation with stock returns starting in 1982. If you look at the studies that confirm beta's predictive power, they all used data from the 1970s. But people still use beta to create portfolios.\n\nHow about efficient market theory? Under the theory, stock bubbles should not exist since everythingn is properly priced. But they do exist. Instagram valued at 1 billion despite having no revenue? Definitely properly priced.\n\nEven option pricing models are ridiculous. One model assumes that you can borrow money at the risk-free rate and stocks only generate risk-free rate returns. The black-scholes model also assumes that risk is normally distributed, without looking at historical data, leading to black and scholes' own bankruptcy. \n\nWanna know how we price stocks? We pull magic numbers out of our asses and make it interact with other equally bullshit number to come up with an arbitrary value. Then we try to convince other people that our bullshit is, in fact, legit. The only way stock valuation models are accurate is if stock analysts are clairvoyant and can see 10 years into the future. But even then the analyst won't have to calculate anything and just tell us the stock price.","title":null,"subreddit":null},"split":"train","summaries":[{"text":" Financial theories need supernatural clairvoyance and are based on arbitrary assumptions that ignore real world and data.

I finally decided on the Forerunner 305 since it would do everything I wanted and was a good price (even though it's huge).\n\nBest price I found online was through Amazon for around $130, with free shipping if I wanted to wait 1-2 weeks. It was available at the local Best Buy for $150. Did a quick search and found a printable coupon good for the month of February at Best Buy for 20% off all \"Health & Fitness\" products.\n\nWent in to Best Buy and the price was $160 on the shelf. I found an employee (just happened to be a cute girl) nearby and told her I wanted to get the 305. She said she had that model and loved it...even more than some of the more expensive ones she tried (even though it's huge). She said she has run some marathons and we chatted a little bit about how I was just starting to run. She told me about some of the runs in the area, how the best ones tend to end with beer, and overall was very pleasant and informative while waiting in line at the cashier. I definitely hope to meet more cool people like her while pursuing this sport.\n\nSo I got to the cashier and the 305 rang up at $160 as expected. I mentioned the web site price was $150 and he price matched it. Then I gave him the 20% off coupon and it wouldn't scan. He tried typing in the number and it wouldn't take it. So he tried again and it accepted the coupon, but didn't apply the discount to the 305. He read the coupon, looked at the GPS, manually entered the 20% off and had a supervisor approve it.

It started in high school, ended last year, and left me in the crap situation of having no idea what I'm doing in terms of dating someone who, as far as I can tell, is really great for me and nails everything I'm looking for in a partner.\n\nAs far as I can tell, she feels the same way about me.

We started texting\/calling back and forth and she seemed into me (long thoughtful responses, exclamation marks, the odd emoji). I asked her out on a second date a week ago and she said yes. The date was set to be today, the day after our second freshman meetup so I texted her saying something along the lines of \"Aren't I lucky I get to spend two days in a row with you!\" to which she responded positively.\n\nOur second date was to be today, the day after another first year meetup. I wasn't particularly flirty with her at the meetup but when I got home I sent her a text saying something along the lines of \"I gotta be up early because I'm lucky enough to be spending the afternoon with a special someone! Night!\". A short while afterwords she said she couldn't meet up because her sister (who doesn't live with her, she lives alone) grounded her for not finishing her calculus assignments. When I asked her how her sister could ground her if she doesn't live with her she said \"she told her everything\". I'm not entirely sure if this is bullshit because she is really busy with this course she's taking (she was even doing work at the meetup last night).

He always gets upset at me for things that shouldn't be an issue at all (like wanting to go out and have a girls night). He spends his days sleeping and playing video games, he has no interest in working or working out or taking care of himself (or me).

{"info":{"id":"t3_1c3dcm","post":"Hey everyone, I recently adopted a cat (about two weeks ago now) She's a 4 year old and is TINY. We set her up in the bathroom because we thought the small space would make it easier for her to transition. So now the problems, she only sits by the toilet when my Fiancee and I are around; She eats in front of me but only if I place the food in front of her and only stands up after extensive petting. She will immediately sit after I'm done petting as well. She's extremely jump and the tiniest noise causes her to curl into a ball and hide her head behind the toilet. She doesn't play, at least not with me, and a laser pointer causes her to go stroke mode and again, hide her head behind the toilet. She doesn't hiss at anything that I've found out yet.. So my question is, does my cat just need more time to get used to her space, and what can I do to get her to come out of her shell? Her history at the shelter says they found her as a new appearance in a Feral colony, so they thought she was a stray. I don't think she's feral because she lets you touch her (not pick her up; and bring your face even close to her is a nono...)

He says some rude things. It would have made since maybe 8 or 9 months ago, because that's what he would tell me. But it wasn't. It was from not even two months ago. He told me he loved me then, and told everyone I was girlfriend then. There was no confusion in our relationship then.

I know this because we've both been very open about our past to each other.\n\n So I let my anger get the best of me and I confront her immediately through text. I ask her what she is doing on facebook and what's the reason that she is looking up these two guys. After much texting back and forth I get the bullshit answer that she was just nosey. I told her we'll talk about it when we get home. \n\nI get home and the conversation practically boils down to as previously that she was just \"nosey\" about what they're up to. I was told that it shouldn't really bother me and that I should be \"cool\" about the whole thing. \n\nWell im not fucking \"cool\" about it. I feel hurt and angry and jealous and confused all at the same time. I want to know why and nosey is an answer that just doesn't cut it for me. And on top of that, she claims that she looks at the one guys profile all the time because she grew up with the family during her childhood and she's seeing if any pictures were posted of them.\n\n Im not okay with this at all, I feel that there is something more. Maybe im looking into this too much but id like any insight that you guys can have for me.\n\n Thanks! \nOh and by the way if the formatting sucks im sorry, on mobile.

Normally when I like a girl, I normally fall quite fast, quite hard for them. However, with this girl, only half the time do I feel infatuated for her, while the other half I'm not very bothered. E.g. Normally when a girl doesn't text me back for a couple of hours, I get quite concerned, but with her, I don't really pay attention. I'm quite confused as to why I'm not feeling fully infatuated with her - Is it because I either:\n\na) Am not really that interested in her. \n\nb) Realise that this relationship is doomed because she is moving back to her home country at the end of next year. \n\nc) Am still numb from the pain that my ex-girlfriend inflicted on me when she cheated on me a year ago.\n\nd) Am growing up\/have a job and therefore the feeling of infatuation has reduced, but I'm also too busy with work to care.\n\ne) All of the above","title":null,"subreddit":null},"split":"train","summaries":[{"text":" Why am I not as infatuated with this girl who is on paper, perfect for me, as I normally am with other girls before?","policy":null,"note":null},{"text":" Normally I fall hard for girls very quickly, but with this girl I don't feel as strongly as I normally do.

{"info":{"id":"t3_2rwiht","post":"I've been with my boyfriend for 3+ years and I have started thinking about the future and marriage. One thing that bothers me sometimes is that I have been purposefully vague about my past relationships and I don't know if I need to open up to him and tell him everything. We are both quiet, introverted people that don't necessarily share every minute detail, so it hasn't been a big deal. \n\nI was in an emotionally abusive relationship in the past, and had a couple of short-term relationships after that where I was still emotionally unstable. I did some things I am not proud of (breaking up by no contact with one guy, dated another controlling man and then kissed someone else so we would break up) when I was younger. However, I've matured and learned about healthy relationships. I've been in 1-2 healthy relationships before I met my current boyfriend. Most people who know me now don't know any of this, and I an genuinely happy and fulfilled in my personal and professional life. It's only when I sometimes think back to the past I sort of freeze up inside.\n\nI have tried to see a couple of therapists (one after I ended the abusive relationship, and one a few years after that). But both of them stopped seeing me after a few sessions because I seemed pretty well-adjusted and was capable of dealing with the issues. I got some good advice about accepting myself and having healthy habits (exercise, eating well, sleeping well, etc.) to cope, but otherwise nothing major. The message I took away was that the past is in the past and I should work on the here and now. \n\nMy question is, do I need to tell my current boyfriend the entire truth? He knows about the abusive relationship (not the details, just that I was in one) and that I was \"wild\" in my youth (but again, not specifically what). I am very happy in my current relationship, we are both supportive of each other, and this never comes up.

I know this is probably her youth talking, but knowing her, she takes the stuff she says way more seriously than the average girl. \n\nI'm afraid she'll take it very hard and her process of recovery will be much longer than it should be.

{"info":{"id":"t3_2rwiht","post":"I've been with my boyfriend for 3+ years and I have started thinking about the future and marriage. One thing that bothers me sometimes is that I have been purposefully vague about my past relationships and I don't know if I need to open up to him and tell him everything. We are both quiet, introverted people that don't necessarily share every minute detail, so it hasn't been a big deal. \n\nI was in an emotionally abusive relationship in the past, and had a couple of short-term relationships after that where I was still emotionally unstable. I did some things I am not proud of (breaking up by no contact with one guy, dated another controlling man and then kissed someone else so we would break up) when I was younger. However, I've matured and learned about healthy relationships. I've been in 1-2 healthy relationships before I met my current boyfriend. Most people who know me now don't know any of this, and I an genuinely happy and fulfilled in my personal and professional life. It's only when I sometimes think back to the past I sort of freeze up inside.\n\nI have tried to see a couple of therapists (one after I ended the abusive relationship, and one a few years after that). But both of them stopped seeing me after a few sessions because I seemed pretty well-adjusted and was capable of dealing with the issues. I got some good advice about accepting myself and having healthy habits (exercise, eating well, sleeping well, etc.) to cope, but otherwise nothing major. The message I took away was that the past is in the past and I should work on the here and now. \n\nMy question is, do I need to tell my current boyfriend the entire truth? He knows about the abusive relationship (not the details, just that I was in one) and that I was \"wild\" in my youth (but again, not specifically what).

During that time I never hit on him even though I felt attracted to him because of my relationship. When that relationship ended, he was one of the people who helped me get back on my feet and even went with me on a holiday because the ex (25 M) and I planned it out before breaking up.

The red flag I should have noticed is he refuses to be Facebook friends or even let me follow his Twitter as he's following mine. The only thing I follow him on is Instagram, which is how I learned that he has a girlfriend. \n\nThe girlfriend (27\/28 F) knew about me THE ENTIRE TIME and decided to post about me on her blog, telling that I chose to play a losing battle. The thing is, I never knew.

He constantly treats her like she's second class, puts her down, completely disregards anything she has to say and when she sticks up for herself or argues back he has no problem getting physical. I would've never expected this type of bullshit from him, and he's never even come close to treating another human being like this, let alone a girlfriend\n\nThe worst part is, this girl is absolutely amazing.

Long story short, it seems my girlfriend doesnt like very much when I hang out with my two friends Julia and Hannah.  Today my gf was out of town for something school related, so I hanged with my two friends.  I always gave Megan info like \"yeah i think ima hang with Julia and Hanna when you're out of town\" and she usually says something like \"haha okay sounds good.\"  And I ask her \"you're fine with that right\" and she'd say \"With Julia? Ya of course.\" There has been a few times where like we'd go to Spot coffee and get some food together, always the 3 of us (Me, Julia, and Hannah). I have always believed Megan had not cared... until today.  \n\nToday Julia and Hannah told me that Megan isnt always very nice to them.  Such as, giving \"looks\" to them in the hall.  Or not saying Hi if they see each other.  Apparently Megan only says hello and stuff when Im with her.  Anyway, I never knew this.  As I said, Megan always seemed perfectly fine with me hanging out with my friends.  In addition, she has a good amount of guy friends, so its not like she doesnt understand..  I hang out with Megan a lot, just not ALL the time, I like hanging with friends too.\n\nIn the end, I would like to talk to Megan about this (In person, not text).

Instant remorse and sorrow set in; despite hardly knowing the person. Then my wife brings up a valid point: what if the person died in the house? Will we still be comfortable to move forward ourselves, given that knowledge? I dismissed this, figuring hey the sellers are young, it probably was an accident of some sort (not trying to sound insensitive here, just trying to get my point across).\n\nI spoke to our lawyer last night, and basically was told that we are in a binding contract, and (barring a homicide or wrongful death in the house of sorts) would need to move forward so long as the seller wishes to move forward. Outside of this, we would need to involve a litigator, and that will create a huge headache I an sure.\n\nNow, we just found out that the seller did indeed die in the house (suddenly).\n\nI don't know how to feel or what to think.

{"info":{"id":"t3_wx3g6","post":"Through my studies (bachelors), I have become more and more disturbed about the \"scientific\" nature of finance. \n\nQuick, what percentage of mutual funds \"beat the market\", i.e. perform better than the index? Studies generally find the number to be between 20 to 30 percent, but in 2011 the number went down to 14%. If these people are so armed with expertise and knowledge, why do people who don't understand anything about financial theory get more just by passively investing in an index fund? If anything, financial \"knowledge\" seems to do more harm than good.\n\nWhen looking at the stuff they teach in universities, you have to wonder how they keep on believing these theories despite the mountain of counterevidence. Stocks are assumed to generate returns relative to risk, quantified as beta in CAPM. Yet, beta has had almost zero correlation with stock returns starting in 1982. If you look at the studies that confirm beta's predictive power, they all used data from the 1970s. But people still use beta to create portfolios.\n\nHow about efficient market theory? Under the theory, stock bubbles should not exist since everythingn is properly priced. But they do exist. Instagram valued at 1 billion despite having no revenue? Definitely properly priced.\n\nEven option pricing models are ridiculous. One model assumes that you can borrow money at the risk-free rate and stocks only generate risk-free rate returns. The black-scholes model also assumes that risk is normally distributed, without looking at historical data, leading to black and scholes' own bankruptcy. \n\nWanna know how we price stocks? We pull magic numbers out of our asses and make it interact with other equally bullshit number to come up with an arbitrary value. Then we try to convince other people that our bullshit is, in fact, legit. The only way stock valuation models are accurate is if stock analysts are clairvoyant and can see 10 years into the future. But even then the analyst won't have to calculate anything and just tell us the stock price.","title":null,"subreddit":null},"split":"train","summaries":[{"text":" Financial theories need supernatural clairvoyance and are based on arbitrary assumptions that ignore real world and data.

I work in HR and have 3 roommates and rarely get a moment to breath. So I recently got a chance to take a lengthy vacation, and I want to use it to take a cross-country road trip I've wanted for a long time. My plan is for it to take around 3 months, I'll be stopping at several national parks, big cities, and visiting my brother. \nThe issue here is that I told my best friend about it and she has assumed that I want her to come as well, since she's recently graduated and this would be a good time for her. While I love my best friend, this is defeating the purpose of the trip. Best friend is extremely extroverted, does not understand the concept of wanting to do something alone. She's also rather princessy, and would likely complain about a lot of the hikes\/nature things I have planned. I wanted to pack my dog up and go, and enjoy some peace and quiet for once in my life.

I was going through some big changes with graduating college and finding a job that was fulfilling for me- my hopes and dreams were a bit unrealistic, and I only worked on and off during college so it was a stressful transition. Anyway, I leaned too much on him for emotional support because we were always around one another and I didn't consider the amount of strain it would put on the relationship. We had other problems, namely expectations of his friends and family. I'm kind of a proponent of the idea that expectations skew reality, but whatever, people still see what they're primed to see.\n\nI think we both wanted to take the relationship to the next level but the reality is that we're not logistically at the same point in life and we might never be. Thiiiis noob was always on my case about how I needed to be more assertive and secure in our relationship, but he didn't have the gall to do the same. He's an extreme people pleaser, and he's becoming a total beefcake who's been swept by the upgrade mentality. Patronizing jerk.\n\nI used to swear that we were made at the same time (close bdays).

Ya of course.\" There has been a few times where like we'd go to Spot coffee and get some food together, always the 3 of us (Me, Julia, and Hannah). I have always believed Megan had not cared... until today.  \n\nToday Julia and Hannah told me that Megan isnt always very nice to them.  Such as, giving \"looks\" to them in the hall.  Or not saying Hi if they see each other.  Apparently Megan only says hello and stuff when Im with her.  Anyway, I never knew this.

We had been there before because we have excellent sexual chemistry, but the romance wasn't there for YEARS.

We both achieved long-sought goals of physical fitness and he was a good motivator. The past two weeks he's been getting cozier. Four days ago he came over and we finally kissed again and we had a loooong talk. I explained that telling somebody you don't love them, and wont have sex with them, isn't a real relationship. He had many many emotional outbursts in the past, which I explained were totally unacceptable. \n\nThen he pulled what feels like a high school girl move and opened up about a dark secret (long story is he was taken advantage of by a Sugar Daddy who helped pay for college expenses and it had repercussions that manifested as intimacy issues). I told him I didn't really give a shit about it. I also told him that I'd be open to another attempt at a relationship but I wont call him my boyfriend or partner until \"It damn well feels like it\".

I had told her I was looking for more than a hookup, and she said the same. She kept telling me how self conscious she is of her body, how much weight she's gained, and would send me pics of her asking if I was okay with her body. In the pics she sent me, she did seem a little chubby, but still very cute. I reassured her that I found her attractive, because from the pics, I really did.\n\nOn to our date. We had a great time together. Spent about 10 hours in total, including some heavy making out and fooling around. The problem is, she's a lot heavier than I had been anticipating. So much so, that I am just not that attracted to her, and had trouble staying hard when we were fooling around.\n\nWe didn't have sex, because she said she wanted to wait until we were \"official\" as if it was inevitable (and I'll admit, through texting, I thought it was inevitable as well). I just don't know what to do. She's already asking me what to do for our next date, and talking about future plans together, and I'm just kind of going along with it because I'm terrified of hurting an already very self-conscious person.

{"info":{"id":"t3_wx3g6","post":"Through my studies (bachelors), I have become more and more disturbed about the \"scientific\" nature of finance. \n\nQuick, what percentage of mutual funds \"beat the market\", i.e. perform better than the index? Studies generally find the number to be between 20 to 30 percent, but in 2011 the number went down to 14%. If these people are so armed with expertise and knowledge, why do people who don't understand anything about financial theory get more just by passively investing in an index fund? If anything, financial \"knowledge\" seems to do more harm than good.\n\nWhen looking at the stuff they teach in universities, you have to wonder how they keep on believing these theories despite the mountain of counterevidence. Stocks are assumed to generate returns relative to risk, quantified as beta in CAPM. Yet, beta has had almost zero correlation with stock returns starting in 1982. If you look at the studies that confirm beta's predictive power, they all used data from the 1970s. But people still use beta to create portfolios.\n\nHow about efficient market theory? Under the theory, stock bubbles should not exist since everythingn is properly priced. But they do exist. Instagram valued at 1 billion despite having no revenue? Definitely properly priced.\n\nEven option pricing models are ridiculous. One model assumes that you can borrow money at the risk-free rate and stocks only generate risk-free rate returns. The black-scholes model also assumes that risk is normally distributed, without looking at historical data, leading to black and scholes' own bankruptcy. \n\nWanna know how we price stocks? We pull magic numbers out of our asses and make it interact with other equally bullshit number to come up with an arbitrary value. Then we try to convince other people that our bullshit is, in fact, legit. The only way stock valuation models are accurate is if stock analysts are clairvoyant and can see 10 years into the future.

I was accepted into both.  They are both fantastic colleges, his even being ranked higher than mine.  However, when after talking it over, we decided that me moving away for college, the college I originally wanted to attend would be the best option.  I was to go to his school, and we were to break up, I would feel silly choosing a college over a boy, he would feel guilty for allowing me to make that choice, and overall we would feel awful.  So we decided on doing the long distance thing.\n\nWe have been going out for over three and a half years, and the last year has been difficult.  But we have survived and are even better than before.  Our relationship seems solid.  We do have issues, and they are often exacerbated by the long distance, but we trudge on.  However, through it all, I feel so guilty for putting our relationship through this.

You Barry Powers?\"\n\"y-yeah..\" He managed to respond. \n\"oh, well, you have a sweet name!\" I said.\n\"ok..\" Mumbled Powers.

I am also pretty high-up in a field which is mostly men, and I feel I have gotten this far by always being better than the men to be considered equal.  I am also an only child taking care of my parents who are both ill.  Lastly, I pursue more hobbies and interests and social contact outside of just my boyfriend to feel fulfilled and satisfied.

She never really did alcohol or any drugs before this to much of any extent but this time she went way farther than she intended and ended up getting very crossfaded. Basically at some point during the night she started getting hit on by her boyfriend at the time's best friend who was sober. She was still a virgin and hadn't even slept with her boyfriend before but this guy convinced her to have sex with him.\nIn the morning she woke up in his shirt and barely remembered anything from the night before, but the fact that she had slept with the guy was fairly apparent. She asked him what had happened and if they even used protection but he wouldn't admit to anything. He wouldn't even say that they had sex. Soon after rumors circulated as they do in high school. She was always known as being incredibly innocent, hell she is a pastor's daughter, but now guys started asking her out of the blue if she would have sex with them if she was drunk. Also rumors got out that she was pregnant (she wasn't).\nAll this had a devastating impact on her self esteem and ego, meanwhile her boyfriend had gotten seriously depressed and was absolutely intolerable to deal with. The guy from the party started talking to her again. They met a few times under different circumstances, he would get her drunk, and have sex with her.\nShe left her boyfriend and soon after stopped seeing the other guy too. By the time that I met her she was obviously very scared to be in a relationship again. She also wouldn't sleep with me for the first few months because she was so scarred by her last experience.

He really, really likes me but the problem is I don't like him as much. It was all fine, until recently I mentioned how it sucks I'll never see him.

He is not my perfect guy, I do not want to commit to him and I am not sure if I even have feelings for him.

I am normally against the puppy for Christmas thing, but she wanted a puppy, the time of year just worked out like that. \n\nI have 3 dogs myself, all rescues, I wasn't overly familiar with the process of buying a dog.

I know I shouldn't have gotten the dog from him. I supported a puppy mill. This poor pup is stained with pee and feces. \n\nSo why did I do it?

I always hear over and over how lack of trust is the #1 dealbreaker in so many relationships, but I honestly feel like being reserved or holding back is just a smart move for alot of reasons. If for example my bf is out for the night and not responding to texts that's ok and I'm not going to interrogate him or go through his texts when I see him, I just mean in a more general sense, as in I feel being reserved and protecting myself\/not trusting him all the way is just the right thing to do generally. I have felt this way in all relationships I've ever had and I see no reason to change really. You never really know someone's true thoughts or feelings, and if you open up you are just going to get hurt, so why not enjoy your relationship while also protecting yourself on some level. He (or anybody else) will never have me completely but I don't think our relationship suffers for it.\n\nCan anyone explain why this is so important to many people? I am not a sociopath I swear, just cautious and I don't see why I should change, but it is a problem to other people I have dated.

She never really did alcohol or any drugs before this to much of any extent but this time she went way farther than she intended and ended up getting very crossfaded. Basically at some point during the night she started getting hit on by her boyfriend at the time's best friend who was sober. She was still a virgin and hadn't even slept with her boyfriend before but this guy convinced her to have sex with him.\nIn the morning she woke up in his shirt and barely remembered anything from the night before, but the fact that she had slept with the guy was fairly apparent. She asked him what had happened and if they even used protection but he wouldn't admit to anything. He wouldn't even say that they had sex. Soon after rumors circulated as they do in high school. She was always known as being incredibly innocent, hell she is a pastor's daughter, but now guys started asking her out of the blue if she would have sex with them if she was drunk. Also rumors got out that she was pregnant (she wasn't).\nAll this had a devastating impact on her self esteem and ego, meanwhile her boyfriend had gotten seriously depressed and was absolutely intolerable to deal with. The guy from the party started talking to her again. They met a few times under different circumstances, he would get her drunk, and have sex with her.\nShe left her boyfriend and soon after stopped seeing the other guy too.

Awful. \n\nAbout a month later my ex (Steve) from less than an hour away just dumped his ex and we entered a sort of FWB situation. We had been there before because we have excellent sexual chemistry, but the romance wasn't there for YEARS. Now, after a month, the first ex (Bart) and I exchanged letters and we agreed to a friendship, he started going to the gym with me and it was a really good. We both achieved long-sought goals of physical fitness and he was a good motivator. The past two weeks he's been getting cozier. Four days ago he came over and we finally kissed again and we had a loooong talk. I explained that telling somebody you don't love them, and wont have sex with them, isn't a real relationship. He had many many emotional outbursts in the past, which I explained were totally unacceptable. \n\nThen he pulled what feels like a high school girl move and opened up about a dark secret (long story is he was taken advantage of by a Sugar Daddy who helped pay for college expenses and it had repercussions that manifested as intimacy issues). I told him I didn't really give a shit about it. I also told him that I'd be open to another attempt at a relationship but I wont call him my boyfriend or partner until \"It damn well feels like it\". Maybe that wasn't fair of me. \n\nSo here I am, between two boys. The FWB (Steve) needs to be made aware because we established an exclusive sexual relationship for health reasons.

She understood that I needed this time, so we went to the library and studied together instead. A few days after we studied, I told her that I liked her and that I enjoyed talking to her. She felt the same way, and said that when she goes to university, she would want to keep talking.\n\n Ever since that day, our conversations have started to gradually decline to the point where she no longer responds to my texts. I've sent her 2 texts asking her if everything was alright and asking her how her day was. I haven't said anything to her that would make her act this way, and I have made the effort of to trying to talk to her about it. At this point, the amount of time I have put into getting to know this girl is insane, and I've gotten to the point where I just want to cut things off with her and move on. She's going to a university outside of my city, while I will be staying here. I need some advice on how I could stop talking to her, without coming off as a jerk. I think of her more as a close friend now, and I want to leave our relationship on a high note if we stop talking.

Instant remorse and sorrow set in; despite hardly knowing the person. Then my wife brings up a valid point: what if the person died in the house? Will we still be comfortable to move forward ourselves, given that knowledge? I dismissed this, figuring hey the sellers are young, it probably was an accident of some sort (not trying to sound insensitive here, just trying to get my point across).\n\nI spoke to our lawyer last night, and basically was told that we are in a binding contract, and (barring a homicide or wrongful death in the house of sorts) would need to move forward so long as the seller wishes to move forward. Outside of this, we would need to involve a litigator, and that will create a huge headache I an sure.\n\nNow, we just found out that the seller did indeed die in the house (suddenly).\n\nI don't know how to feel or what to think.

{"info":{"id":"t3_4un3dg","post":"I don't know how to ask this without it sounding really silly, but this is a genuine problem. I created a throwaway because of too much personal detail in my main account. \n\nMy boyfriend and I are both grad students and have been together for four months now. I absolutely love him. He's sweet, caring, tolerant, liberal, basically every single thing on my 'checklist', if I had one, is there. \n\nThe problem, though, is he talks VERY slowly. I mean his speed is really slow. If I ask him anything, he takes about 3 seconds before he starts to talk, then when he starts, the words go at a very slow pace,and he even pauses for 3-5 seconds in the middle of his sentence. I get really impatient and sometimes just feel like telling him to hurry up (of course I don't, but I really feel like doing so). \n\nI asked him today, very gently, why he spoke so slow, and he said he just gets thoughts very slowly in his brain. He then went on to say he's just generally slow at thinking. I felt really sad when he said this, I don't know why.

{"info":{"id":"t3_1m2wxb","post":"My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 2 years. It's been a long-distance relationship (we met online) but we've spent time together in person and are madly in love and want to spent the rest of our lives together. I recently started attending college and my boyfriend and I were so excited because we had been planning on him moving out there with me (he attended trade school and is now working and has the flexibility to move). He has purchased an apartment and a plane ticket and is planning to come out here at the end of October. \n\nMy parents, however, are completely against it. They've gone overboard (my mom threw away everything in my room back home, she's trying to convince my dad to sell my car, and she's trying to get me to pay for everything entirely on my own i.e. insurance and whatnot). \n\nMy mom and I were always friends and my dad was the mean one, but the roles have flipped, even though my dad is still against it too. They are concerned I'll begin to completely ignore my friends and not get involved with anything (I'm in music ensembles, the cycling club, and the residence hall senate).\n\nHe completely refuses to wait any longer, which I fully understand. At home, he has only one real friend due to everything being expensive in New York City so he doesn't like going out with people. He isn't close with his family and is just very lonely. He will not wait any longer to move, regardless of what my parents will do.\n\nI don't want to completely ruin my relationship with my parents, I mean, they're my parents and they've given up a lot for me over the past 18 years. But I also couldn't imagine my life without my boyfriend. My parents want me to have the \"college experience,\" even though I feel like they are the ones that are messing that up. They call me daily and cause me to cry, which then causes me to lock myself up in my room and not spend time with my friends.\n\nI love my boyfriend and I don't want to lose him.

Anyways, I have never driven in the rain so I knew I'll run into trouble on my way back home from work. Hydro planing sounded familiar to me but never knew it's real consequences. Coming up to my turn where for a good mile (in Dominic torretto voice) I'm free. On the turn there was a huge size puddle of water. I tried to avoid it completly but knew and figured that the front right tire will hit the water. Remember that word \"hydroplane\", yeah I fucked up. The left front tire went over then sunk, causing me the turn into the side of the road. Closer to the edge, the water is deeper. My engine choked, I'm really fucked. Knew trying to keep turning the key will only make things worst. I got out, in ankle deep water, had the bitch in neutral and pushed to the corner of the turn. On the bright side of this whole predicament, a trucker got out of his rig and helped me push the water logged car to the edge. Once out of the water, I tried to give life to my racecar. Once she turned back on I booked it home. Ran the same as before except for a knocking noise. The noise just hurts thinking about it.

{"info":{"id":"t3_wx3g6","post":"Through my studies (bachelors), I have become more and more disturbed about the \"scientific\" nature of finance. \n\nQuick, what percentage of mutual funds \"beat the market\", i.e. perform better than the index? Studies generally find the number to be between 20 to 30 percent, but in 2011 the number went down to 14%. If these people are so armed with expertise and knowledge, why do people who don't understand anything about financial theory get more just by passively investing in an index fund? If anything, financial \"knowledge\" seems to do more harm than good.\n\nWhen looking at the stuff they teach in universities, you have to wonder how they keep on believing these theories despite the mountain of counterevidence. Stocks are assumed to generate returns relative to risk, quantified as beta in CAPM. Yet, beta has had almost zero correlation with stock returns starting in 1982. If you look at the studies that confirm beta's predictive power, they all used data from the 1970s. But people still use beta to create portfolios.\n\nHow about efficient market theory? Under the theory, stock bubbles should not exist since everythingn is properly priced. But they do exist. Instagram valued at 1 billion despite having no revenue? Definitely properly priced.\n\nEven option pricing models are ridiculous. One model assumes that you can borrow money at the risk-free rate and stocks only generate risk-free rate returns. The black-scholes model also assumes that risk is normally distributed, without looking at historical data, leading to black and scholes' own bankruptcy. \n\nWanna know how we price stocks? We pull magic numbers out of our asses and make it interact with other equally bullshit number to come up with an arbitrary value. Then we try to convince other people that our bullshit is, in fact, legit. The only way stock valuation models are accurate is if stock analysts are clairvoyant and can see 10 years into the future. But even then the analyst won't have to calculate anything and just tell us the stock price.","title":null,"subreddit":null},"split":"train","summaries":[{"text":" Is finance a pseudoscience?

We started texting\/calling back and forth and she seemed into me (long thoughtful responses, exclamation marks, the odd emoji). I asked her out on a second date a week ago and she said yes. The date was set to be today, the day after our second freshman meetup so I texted her saying something along the lines of \"Aren't I lucky I get to spend two days in a row with you!\" to which she responded positively.\n\nOur second date was to be today, the day after another first year meetup. I wasn't particularly flirty with her at the meetup but when I got home I sent her a text saying something along the lines of \"I gotta be up early because I'm lucky enough to be spending the afternoon with a special someone! Night!\". A short while afterwords she said she couldn't meet up because her sister (who doesn't live with her, she lives alone) grounded her for not finishing her calculus assignments. When I asked her how her sister could ground her if she doesn't live with her she said \"she told her everything\". I'm not entirely sure if this is bullshit because she is really busy with this course she's taking (she was even doing work at the meetup last night).

We had been there before because we have excellent sexual chemistry, but the romance wasn't there for YEARS.

We both achieved long-sought goals of physical fitness and he was a good motivator. The past two weeks he's been getting cozier. Four days ago he came over and we finally kissed again and we had a loooong talk. I explained that telling somebody you don't love them, and wont have sex with them, isn't a real relationship. He had many many emotional outbursts in the past, which I explained were totally unacceptable. \n\nThen he pulled what feels like a high school girl move and opened up about a dark secret (long story is he was taken advantage of by a Sugar Daddy who helped pay for college expenses and it had repercussions that manifested as intimacy issues). I told him I didn't really give a shit about it. I also told him that I'd be open to another attempt at a relationship but I wont call him my boyfriend or partner until \"It damn well feels like it\".

He told me he couldn\u2019t handle being so far apart from me anymore and it was causing him a lot of stress. I felt the same way too; I had a lot of anxiety, and so we decided to stay as friends. We still talked regularly as if nothing had changed, except that we cut the \u201cI love you\u2019s\u201d and pet names. But 2 weeks ago I found out that he has a new girlfriend. I was more upset about the fact that he didn\u2019t tell me about it. I suppose because we were friends now we could talk about anything, especially about something as major as that. He said he was afraid to \u201close\u201d me if he\u2019d told me.\n\nHe still talks to me regularly. I try to avoid him when I can now. I thought he\u2019d rather focus on his new relationship, and so I started talking to a guy on Tinder. We\u2019d meet regularly, mainly for sex. At some point I just forgot to check my phone so I was avoiding calls and texts from my ex. He then asked me if he\u2019d done something wrong because he felt that I was avoiding him. \n\nWhen I told him I was seeing someone, he became really upset\/jealous and even said that I deserve better than a guy who just wants to fuck me. We talked for 3 hours about this, and he admitted that he still has feelings for me, that he really loves me but the distance is holding us back.

{"info":{"id":"t3_wx3g6","post":"Through my studies (bachelors), I have become more and more disturbed about the \"scientific\" nature of finance. \n\nQuick, what percentage of mutual funds \"beat the market\", i.e. perform better than the index? Studies generally find the number to be between 20 to 30 percent, but in 2011 the number went down to 14%. If these people are so armed with expertise and knowledge, why do people who don't understand anything about financial theory get more just by passively investing in an index fund? If anything, financial \"knowledge\" seems to do more harm than good.\n\nWhen looking at the stuff they teach in universities, you have to wonder how they keep on believing these theories despite the mountain of counterevidence. Stocks are assumed to generate returns relative to risk, quantified as beta in CAPM. Yet, beta has had almost zero correlation with stock returns starting in 1982. If you look at the studies that confirm beta's predictive power, they all used data from the 1970s. But people still use beta to create portfolios.\n\nHow about efficient market theory? Under the theory, stock bubbles should not exist since everythingn is properly priced. But they do exist. Instagram valued at 1 billion despite having no revenue? Definitely properly priced.\n\nEven option pricing models are ridiculous. One model assumes that you can borrow money at the risk-free rate and stocks only generate risk-free rate returns. The black-scholes model also assumes that risk is normally distributed, without looking at historical data, leading to black and scholes' own bankruptcy. \n\nWanna know how we price stocks? We pull magic numbers out of our asses and make it interact with other equally bullshit number to come up with an arbitrary value. Then we try to convince other people that our bullshit is, in fact, legit. The only way stock valuation models are accurate is if stock analysts are clairvoyant and can see 10 years into the future.

{"info":{"id":"t3_fkqf1","post":"So I did some looking around at different models of wrist mount GPS units. Cost and functionality were the biggest concern. I finally decided on the Forerunner 305 since it would do everything I wanted and was a good price (even though it's huge).\n\nBest price I found online was through Amazon for around $130, with free shipping if I wanted to wait 1-2 weeks. It was available at the local Best Buy for $150. Did a quick search and found a printable coupon good for the month of February at Best Buy for 20% off all \"Health & Fitness\" products.\n\nWent in to Best Buy and the price was $160 on the shelf. I found an employee (just happened to be a cute girl) nearby and told her I wanted to get the 305. She said she had that model and loved it...even more than some of the more expensive ones she tried (even though it's huge). She said she has run some marathons and we chatted a little bit about how I was just starting to run. She told me about some of the runs in the area, how the best ones tend to end with beer, and overall was very pleasant and informative while waiting in line at the cashier. I definitely hope to meet more cool people like her while pursuing this sport.\n\nSo I got to the cashier and the 305 rang up at $160 as expected. I mentioned the web site price was $150 and he price matched it. Then I gave him the 20% off coupon and it wouldn't scan. He tried typing in the number and it wouldn't take it. So he tried again and it accepted the coupon, but didn't apply the discount to the 305. He read the coupon, looked at the GPS, manually entered the 20% off and had a supervisor approve it. Super easy, out the door for $120.\n\nThe coupon should work on any \"Garmin Fitness GPS\" (that's an actual category on the Best Buy website), as well as any heart rate monitor or other brand of fitness GPS.\n\nHere's a link to the coupon. Hopefully it will be useful for someone out there within the next couple weeks.

I finally decided on the Forerunner 305 since it would do everything I wanted and was a good price (even though it's huge).\n\nBest price I found online was through Amazon for around $130, with free shipping if I wanted to wait 1-2 weeks. It was available at the local Best Buy for $150. Did a quick search and found a printable coupon good for the month of February at Best Buy for 20% off all \"Health & Fitness\" products.\n\nWent in to Best Buy and the price was $160 on the shelf. I found an employee (just happened to be a cute girl) nearby and told her I wanted to get the 305. She said she had that model and loved it...even more than some of the more expensive ones she tried (even though it's huge). She said she has run some marathons and we chatted a little bit about how I was just starting to run. She told me about some of the runs in the area, how the best ones tend to end with beer, and overall was very pleasant and informative while waiting in line at the cashier. I definitely hope to meet more cool people like her while pursuing this sport.\n\nSo I got to the cashier and the 305 rang up at $160 as expected. I mentioned the web site price was $150 and he price matched it. Then I gave him the 20% off coupon and it wouldn't scan. He tried typing in the number and it wouldn't take it. So he tried again and it accepted the coupon, but didn't apply the discount to the 305. He read the coupon, looked at the GPS, manually entered the 20% off and had a supervisor approve it. Super easy, out the door for $120.\n\nThe coupon should work on any \"Garmin Fitness GPS\" (that's an actual category on the Best Buy website), as well as any heart rate monitor or other brand of fitness GPS.\n\nHere's a link to the coupon.

The car was shitty to others but a full blown race car to me. Looked like crap but ran like a champ. Anyways, I have never driven in the rain so I knew I'll run into trouble on my way back home from work. Hydro planing sounded familiar to me but never knew it's real consequences. Coming up to my turn where for a good mile (in Dominic torretto voice) I'm free. On the turn there was a huge size puddle of water. I tried to avoid it completly but knew and figured that the front right tire will hit the water. Remember that word \"hydroplane\", yeah I fucked up. The left front tire went over then sunk, causing me the turn into the side of the road. Closer to the edge, the water is deeper. My engine choked, I'm really fucked. Knew trying to keep turning the key will only make things worst. I got out, in ankle deep water, had the bitch in neutral and pushed to the corner of the turn. On the bright side of this whole predicament, a trucker got out of his rig and helped me push the water logged car to the edge. Once out of the water, I tried to give life to my racecar. Once she turned back on I booked it home. Ran the same as before except for a knocking noise. The noise just hurts thinking about it. From the advice from other gearheads, it can't be easy to fix or safe to use without causing more damage. Already made a craigslist ad to at least get some money for another one.

I was standing in front of the stage, just zoning out and listening to the guys play. \n\nAll of a sudden, I noticed two (lady) arms shooting out around my sides. I ignored it thinking she was trying to dance with someone behind me. She continues to dance and makes her way in front of me. I'm still kinda just zoning out and don't really pay much attention, until her face is about two inches away from mine. She asks me if I'm having a good time and I of course say yes. She then asks why I'm not dancing, and I lie and say I don't know how. I proceed to do a kind of stupid shimmy thing, because why be serious? \n\nShe laughed and said that was how she danced too, and started doing it next to me. I continued to do so for a minute or so, and then stopped. She leaned in again and said something, but I couldn't hear her over the music. Instead of asking her to repeat herself, or moving away from the stage and speakers to talk, I proceeded to just give her a small smile, like she said something funny. She kept dancing next to me for a few songs, gave me a weird look, and left with her friend, who I guess was behind me the entire time. \n\nAbout fifteen minutes later, the band takes a break, and my buddy who was playing came up to me and asked me why I didn't dance with the girl.

This was my first dog, and I was in 6th grade when I got her. Recently she's been acting different. I know she's old, but I read that rat terrier's life expectancy is 17-24 years old on google. She hasn't been to the vet ever, my parents don't have extra money for vet fees and pills for dogs. Other than that she has been a happy lively gal.  Here are some symptoms:\n-Walks slow and responds slow; she barely even does what I tell her to do for a treat like roll over or sit. She just looks at me.\n-she has slipped walking to the kitchen on our tile.\n-She pee's quite frequently on the carpet.\n-She lost most of her front teeth by now and her back molars are rotting. \n-She doesn't run to the door when someone rings the door bell.\n\nI am quite worried about her because she could not make it into the house after a walk this morning, a small step up into the doorway. I am thinking about going to the vet and seeing what's wrong with her this weekend. With my own money, I am a broke college student but I can't bear to see my baby like this. I almost had a panic attack on my way home because my mom didn't come straight home after work. She was left alone. \n\nI've been trying to get outside with her, but shes super slow and just wants to go back inside most of the time.\n\nAlso, I want to have her meals cooked fresh (ground turkey and pumpkin or something like that) because of her lack of teeth.","title":null,"subreddit":null},"split":"train","summaries":[{"text":" My 10 year old rat terrier is acting very slow and not doing what I ask her to do.

{"info":{"id":"t3_wx3g6","post":"Through my studies (bachelors), I have become more and more disturbed about the \"scientific\" nature of finance. \n\nQuick, what percentage of mutual funds \"beat the market\", i.e. perform better than the index? Studies generally find the number to be between 20 to 30 percent, but in 2011 the number went down to 14%. If these people are so armed with expertise and knowledge, why do people who don't understand anything about financial theory get more just by passively investing in an index fund? If anything, financial \"knowledge\" seems to do more harm than good.\n\nWhen looking at the stuff they teach in universities, you have to wonder how they keep on believing these theories despite the mountain of counterevidence. Stocks are assumed to generate returns relative to risk, quantified as beta in CAPM. Yet, beta has had almost zero correlation with stock returns starting in 1982. If you look at the studies that confirm beta's predictive power, they all used data from the 1970s. But people still use beta to create portfolios.\n\nHow about efficient market theory? Under the theory, stock bubbles should not exist since everythingn is properly priced. But they do exist. Instagram valued at 1 billion despite having no revenue? Definitely properly priced.\n\nEven option pricing models are ridiculous. One model assumes that you can borrow money at the risk-free rate and stocks only generate risk-free rate returns. The black-scholes model also assumes that risk is normally distributed, without looking at historical data, leading to black and scholes' own bankruptcy. \n\nWanna know how we price stocks? We pull magic numbers out of our asses and make it interact with other equally bullshit number to come up with an arbitrary value. Then we try to convince other people that our bullshit is, in fact, legit. The only way stock valuation models are accurate is if stock analysts are clairvoyant and can see 10 years into the future.
